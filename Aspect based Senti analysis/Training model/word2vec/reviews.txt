This is my Moto x play 16gb variant and I have to say the look is perfect after all these months. The display is very good. No blur images and I have to say its still look like a damn good phone. I don't remember how many times I put my phone down but see there are no major damage in the outer surface except this little tiny bend. Also I uses this chevron armored back case for my device which gives my phone an extra protection. Some of them don't like this case because it make the phone look bulky and uncomfortable to use and yes its all depend on your preference. I would recommend to use any back case of your choice for the below link which are the best cases for moto x play. And overall after 10 months the display seems to be good and vibrant.
