In\nbeginning I was thinking that I have made mistake by buying this fan but on\nuse of a week I realise that it is giving more air than my previous 370 RPM\nFan.  \nExcellent built quality, Very low noise. Consume 62 Watts of power which is\nagain low. It attracts very low amount of dust on blades and no need to worry\nto frequent clean of blades as it is built of glass filled fibre so it can't\nget damaged from unclean dust.  \nI recommend this fan to buyers who actually looking for beauties in fan.\n\n", "Its a premium product. It adds to the premium look of your house. Its quiet\nand the breeze covers more area compared to traditional design fans.\n\n", "Awesome quality, great performance, very high airflow. There is one more model\nwith Orient Electric which has same shape, size and colors but it has BLDC\nTechnology I strongly recommend to buy that model as it consumes about half\nthe Electricity compared to this model. BLDC model is priced little higher\nthan this one but it's worth buying. No doubt this model is great too compared\nto other fans in market.\n\n", "Received without the back cover on 2 of the fan blades. Returned for\ncorrection and resupply.  \nReceived the same piece the second time as well. Had to cancel and look\noffline for the product.\n\n", "I needed a new fan for my bedroom as my Havells fan was making a lot of noise\ndespite repairs. I needed a silent fan to have less noise interference when I\nhave my headphones on.  \n  \nPros:  \nThe build quality of the fan is excellent. It also has a premium look to it.\nIt looks really good. The motor is also heavy which does not necessarily mean\nbut can be an indicator of durability.  \nOn a 5 step regulator, the fan is truly silent on steps 1 and 2. Even on rest\nof the steps the fan is comparatively silent than other fans. The only noise\naudible is that of the wind.  \n  \nCons:  \nOrient has sacrificed some RPM to make the fan silent which in turn affects\nthe airflow as compared to other fans. The air does not reach uniformly\noutside the radius of the fan. Due to this the fan can only be recommended for\nsmall bedrooms and not master bedrooms or living rooms with an exception if it\nneeds to be placed above a TV or any other audio system to reduce\ninterference.  \n  \nOverall great aesthetics, good at being silent but sub par performance which\nis very disappointing for the premium price tag.\n\n", "The misconception with this fan is that it\u2019s not fast enough. But it doesn\u2019t\nhave to be. I use this fan at 25-50% of the speed there is sufficient airflow\nto keep the air moving but nothing that will blow your papers and clothes\naway. It is for those who want a quiet room. The joints between the blades and\nthe motor are thick and strong expect no loosening any time soon and those\nmetal noises due to vibrations.\n\n", "Not as silent as claimed but better than most.
