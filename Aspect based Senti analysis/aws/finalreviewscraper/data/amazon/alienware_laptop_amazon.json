But the laptop I got has TN panel (the older version). In this\nprice range it is the best laptop you can find for Gaming.  \nPros:  \nDoesn't heat up.  \nRuns games smoothly on high settings with good fps. (might not able to run all\nthe games on hilg settings)  \nBuilt quality is very good, performance is also great.  \nCons:  \nScreen quality is not that great but its not that bad either as side view\nangles are fine, just up and down angles are not so great.  \nIt is a fingerprint magnet (if that is a major problem for u).  \n  \nI didn't had any problems with the cons I listed so I purchased it.  \nFinal verdict: If you are looking for gaming laptop in this range then go for\nit and if you want to do 4k video editing then this might not be for u.  \nPs: If you are getting newer version with IPS level display then it will\nsurely have very good display.\n\n", "It's best and affordable gaming laptop.
