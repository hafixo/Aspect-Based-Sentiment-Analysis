I brought it as I am a fan of the series.  \nAbout the product it arrived in a good condition and on time you also get a\nredeem code for the optional add on content chemical revolution mission but\nthe code did not work for me but I suppose it will only work for the U.S. PSN\naccount not sure though. The game has an update file of around 6 GB it\u2019s up to\nyou download it or not.  \nAbout Amazon and the seller the delivery and packing was good and the product\nwas delivered earlier than the expected date of delivery.
