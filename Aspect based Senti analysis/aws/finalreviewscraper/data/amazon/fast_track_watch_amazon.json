If you have a wrist of 6inch or lower this is the only\nFastrack watch that will fit in your wrist. Anything over case diameter of\n40mm will be too big for your watch. I got it for 1965 during the Indian\nfestival offer. I gave it 4stars instead of 5 because of the following\nreasons.  \nCons.....  \n1\\. Case is too thick for my liking.  \n2\\. In silent places it will make clicking noise of the second hand.  \n3\\. Can be slightly uncomfortable because of the weight.\n\n", "I am very disappointed to receive a used product.
