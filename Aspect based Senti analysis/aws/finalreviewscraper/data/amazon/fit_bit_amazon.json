It is my duty to disillusion you.  \nI recently purchased a Mi Band 2 and since the Charge 2 was on sale I thought,\nwhy not? I could give the Mi Band away as a gift and use this one myself. Boy\nam I glad I didn't give the Mi Band away.  \nThe Mi Band had a tendency of under-counting my steps. The Charge 2 on the\nother hand over counted my steps by a far far greater margin. For instance 2\nkilometer walk showed up as 3.3 kms. What's more the feature that pulled GPS\ndata from the phone didn't work for my device, at all. Pairing with my phone\n(a Galaxy Note 3) was fairly spotty as well. The process could take anywhere\nfrom 2 minutes to 15 depending it seemed completely on luck and the\ntemperament of the tracker. I was of course more than willing to put it down\nto one faulty device so I called up Fitbit and asked for help, naively hoping\nthat their vaunted claims of customer service would be true.  \nIn the beginning it did indeed seem to be so. They very politely asked my\nproblems. But the follow up was slow. Still I plodded on and some 3 phone\ncalls, 5 email and 4 days later wrote to me that they would send me a\nreplacement. That is where things started going downhill and rapidly. Their\ncustomer service in reality is worse than a third rate e-commerce website.\nFirst off the associates who handle the phones have no authority whatsoever.\nAll serious problems are transferred onward and you might have to wait\nanywhere from 24 hours to more than 4 days, since the senior 'team' does not\nwork on Fridays or Saturdays or Sundays. Also regardless of where you live,\nany warranty claims that require a replacement tracker to be sent by them,\nwill first require you to have the faulty tracker shipped to them at your own\nexpense. The liability during transit is entirely yours so if the package is\nlost by the courier company or in some way damaged, you're out your money and\nthey won't send you the replacement.  \nConsidering that the device was brand new and this is the kind of service they\noffered (one of the reps I spoke to actually used the phrase 'appeasing the\ncustomer', meaning they do the bare minimum to keep you from flipping off,\nwhen they can), I shudder to think what might have happened had I used it for\na few months.  \nAlso if someone gives the tracker to you as a gift or if the name on the\npurchase receipt isn't your own, you'll find yourself in an even more adverse\nsituation. Apparently they put in lesser effort to 'appease' you if you didn't\npay for the tracker and got it as a gift.  \nSo to sum up, if you're thinking of getting a Fitbit, in India, don't. The\nXiaomi tracker is one sixth the price and gives you the same basic\ninformation. The only thing that could've made this tracker worth it would\nhave been some great support in case of problems which Xiaomi lacks. But\nFitbit buried that hope six feet under and IMO their reputation with it.  \nSo, buyer beware. Or better, don't buy.  \nUpdate:  \nCherry on top. Once you get fed up Fitbit support and decide to give up and\njust delete your account, what you won't be told (unless you ask) is that\nwhile the majority of your data that Fitbit stores on their servers and backup\nservers will be removed 'in a while' (They won't specify when), an unspecified\namount of 'de-identified' data they gather about you is theirs to keep once\nyou make that account and agree to their terms and conditions. They will not\nspecify how exactly they de-identify this data or what it includes about your\nhealth and conditions. You just have to take their word for it. And they're\nfree to use this data as they see fit.....  \nUpdate 2:  \nIt bears worth mentioning that with the latest update to Mifit app the\ndifference in features being offered by Charge 2 and Mi Band 2 has narrowed\ndown even further. Just like Charge 2 and Fitbit app, the Mifit app now lets\nyour band track runs using the phone's GPS as long as the phone is with you\nwhile running, it also has continuous HR monitoring as an option during this\nmode.\n\n", "People really love their Fitbits. This is evidenced by sales numbers alone:\nFitbit sells more activity trackers than anyone else. Anecdotally, Fitbits\nabound: walk through any airport, hike any trail, jog through your\nneighborhood streets, and you will likely see someone wearing a Fitbit.  \n  \nSo it\u2019s not surprising that so many people have asked me about the new Fitbit\nCharge 2 when they\u2019ve spied it on my wrist recently. The midrange Charge 2 is\nthe successor to (and replacement of) the Charge HR activity-tracking\nwristband. The $149 Charge HR, with its optical heart rate sensors and its\nability to automatically recognize exercise activities, really hit the sweet\nspot for a lot of people when it came out in 2015 \u2014 so much so that it\u2019s still\nFitbit\u2019s best seller more than 18 months later. The Charge 2 aims to do all of\nthis plus more, and for the same price.  \n  \nWhat more could it possibly do, you ask? For one, it has a bigger display than\nthe Charge HR. Four times bigger, to be exact. It\u2019s a tap-sensitive, OLED\ndisplay. The Charge 2 most definitely looks like a fitness tracker, not a\nbracelet or anything suggestive of a \"fashion\" wearable. But this key design\nchange enables a multi-sport mode: tap on the display once for running, tap on\nit again for biking, and so on. Fitbit has also added \"connected GPS\" to the\nCharge 2: the wristband will pull GPS data from the phone while you\u2019re\nwalking, running, or hiking outdoors.  \n  \nFitbit-Charge-2  \nFitbit-Charge-2  \nTHE PROMISE IS GREAT, THE REALITY IS DIFFERENT  \nThe promise is great. It\u2019s a Charge HR on steroids, a Charge HR that pushes\nyou to do more beyond just basic step-counting and sleep-tracking.  \n  \nBut it didn\u2019t fulfill that promise for me. I found notable discrepancies in\ndistances tracked with the Charge 2 compared to GPS sport watches (something\nFitbit said was due to bugs after multiple attempts to troubleshoot the\nissues).  \n  \nFirst, at the most basic level, the Fitbit Charge 2 does what many other\nactivity trackers do. It records your daily step count, stairs climbed,\ncalories burned, distance traveled, heart rate, and sleep patterns. It will\nshow notifications from your smartphone, like incoming phone calls and\ncalendar alerts.  \n  \nThe Charge 2 also has dedicated functions for recording workouts, something\nthat the Charge HR didn\u2019t have. These include running, walking, hiking,\nbiking, and elliptical workouts. There\u2019s even an interval mode, in which the\nFitbit pulses on your wrist to tell you when to stop and start an activity; I\nreally liked this. And it will record weight-lifting sessions.  \n  \nThere's also a new feature called Cardio Fitness Score. It\u2019s a combo hardware-\nsoftware feature: Fitbit uses your resting heart rate, recorded with the\nwristband; some of your exercise data; and your profile information, to assign\na heart-health score, found in the heart rate section of the mobile app.\nAnything over 44.9 is \"excellent\" for my age and gender, according to Fitbit.  \n  \nBut of the half-dozen distance tests I did in either Run, Walk, or Hike mode,\nthe Charge 2 only accurately recorded one event, a 5K run (3.11 miles).\nOtherwise, distances were off, whether I used Fitbit\u2019s connected GPS feature\nor not. A 1-mile walk was recorded as 0.71 mile on the Charge 2. A 3-mile run\nwas recorded as 2.13 miles. A 3.6-mile hike was recorded as 3.3 miles.  \n  \nFitbit-Charge-2  \nTo try to solve this, and partly at Fitbit\u2019s request, I switched from a new\niPhone 7 back to an older iPhone, since the iPhone 7 just came out and it was\nsuggested that there may have been compatibility issues. Fitbit also sent me a\nnew Charge 2 wristband. I tried that, too.  \nDISTANCES WERE OFF IN ALMOST EVERY TEST  \nStill, the distance-tracking was disappointing. Just this past weekend, a\n4.28-mile hike was recorded as a 3.83-mile hike on the Charge 2 (without GPS),\nand it measured a 3.02-mile run as a 2.82-mile run, even while using connected\nGPS. Seems I\u2019m not alone, either; some other Fitbit users have reported\ninaccurate distances in Fitbit\u2019s online forums.  \n  \nFitbit initially suggested it may have been my stride length or the fact that\nI was pausing to walk during runs that may have been causing this. Eventually,\nthe company said they've identified a bug in the software on Charge 2 that\ncauses inaccurate distance estimates when using Connected GPS to track the\nWalk and Hike activities. With regards to some of the other discrepancies,\nFitbit says the company is continuing to investigate it.  \n  \nThere was another software bug as well that showed an outdated distance on the\ndisplay when I would first raise my wrist during a run. After lowering my\nwrist and raising it back up again, sometimes more than once, the reading\nwould adjust itself.  \n  \nFitbit-Charge-2  \nIt\u2019s not just the inaccurate distances that befuddled me, though that has been\nby far my biggest problem with the Charge 2. Fitbit added a big display and\nmultiple-sport modes to the wristband\u2026 but didn\u2019t add a pause function. No\nbutton, no tap-to-pause option, nothing. So if you need to stop during a\nworkout \u2014 to tie your shoe, wait for a friend, or catch your breath \u2014 you\ncan\u2019t. It\u2019s also not waterproof.  \n  \nThen there\u2019s the Charge 2\u2019s Relax feature, which guides you through deep\nbreathing exercises. Apple introduced a similar feature called Breathe in its\nnew Apple Watch software; though Fitbit has said its Relax app is more\npersonalized, because it uses your heart rate to gauge your breathing rate.  \n  \nBut when you launch into Relax mode, which lasts either two or five minutes,\nthe Charge 2 doesn\u2019t offer you any kind of haptic feedback to guide you\nthrough it. You actually have to stare at your Fitbit\u2019s display for two to\nfive minutes to see a digital representation of your breathing, a circle\nswelling and shrinking in size. I don\u2019t really meditate, but I\u2019m certain most\nmediation exercises don\u2019t begin with \"Hold your gaze on your activity\ntracker.\"  \n  \nFitbit-Charge-2  \nOf course, you\u2019re also buying into some good features when you buy a Fitbit,\notherwise it wouldn't be so popular. The first is the software. Fitbit\u2019s\nmobile app is free to use, but the fact that it\u2019s complimentary isn\u2019t what\nmakes it good. It\u2019s good because it\u2019s agnostic. The Fitbit app works with iOS,\nAndroid, hell, even Windows Phone phones, and it runs on desktops, too, a nice\ninclusion of people who still don\u2019t have or can\u2019t be bothered with\nsmartphones.  \n  \nThe Fitbit app, which was recently redesigned, has a user-friendly interface.\nAt the top of your dashboard you\u2019ll see your steps for the day, with arrows on\neither side to jump a day before or forward again; below that are snapshots of\nfloors climbed, miles traveled, calories burned, and minutes of exercise. All\nof this sits on top of a series of customizable tiles that show things like\nheart rate, sleep data, even how much water you\u2019ve consumed that day. (Some of\nthis requires manual entry on the part of the user.)  \n  \nFitbit-Charge-2  \nFitbit still doesn\u2019t share its data with Google Fit or Apple Health, which not\nonly act as repositories for health data but also share the data with other\napps. Instead, Fitbit has direct data-sharing partnerships with a bunch of\nhealth and fitness apps, including Strava, RunKeeper, MapMyRun, MyFitnessPal,\nWeight Watchers, Lost It!, even Amazon\u2019s Alexa app.  \n  \nBut to its credit, Fitbit has almost perfected the art of subtle motivation,\nif you could just get past how demotivating the accuracy issues are.\n\"Overachiever!\" the app practically shouts if you\u2019ve far surpassed your daily\nstep goal. You can also set weekly exercise goals in the app. While I was\nlargely inspired by the need to test \u2014 and test again, and again \u2014 the Fitbit,\nit was nice to get that five-day exercise badge.  \n  \nFITBIT HAS ALMOST PERFECTED THE ART OF SUBTLE MOTIVATION  \n  \nThese slaps on the back, these virtual nudges, aren\u2019t limited to the mobile\napp; they happen on the Fitbit itself, too. \"Take me for a walk?\" the Charge 2\npleads, in scrolling text across the display, if you haven\u2019t moved in a while.\nOther times, it\u2019s more specific with its requests: \"Feed me 250 steps.\" Sure,\nI could do 250 steps, you think. That\u2019s not much. When you hit your daily step\ngoal, little pixelated fireworks light up the display.  \n  \nThe Charge 2 automatically tracks your more vigorous activities, too, even if\nyou don\u2019t bother to put it into multi-sport mode. (This \"smart track\" feature\nis available on a few different Fitbits now, and a lot of competing wristbands\ndo this, too.) My bike rides to appointments or a coffee meeting showed up in\nthe app as exercise completed, even though I didn\u2019t \"tell\" the Fitbit I was\ndoing it.  \n  \nFinally, the Fitbit Charge 2 will last nearly a week on a single charge, even\nwith its larger display and multi-sport features. That\u2019s not as impressive as\nthe months-long battery life you\u2019ll get with a Garmin Vivofit or a display-\nfree Misfit tracker, but it\u2019s a lot better than the one-day battery life of an\nApple Watch.  \n  \nFitbit Charge 2  \nStill, it\u2019s hard not to feel as though Fitbit\u2019s approach to product releases\nthis year has been more about volume than about innovation. The company has\nreleased four new wearables since the winter: the bracelet-like Alta (which I\nliked), the smartwatch-like Blaze, the entry-level Flex 2, and this one, the\nCharge 2, all of which come with a new aesthetic but improve on preexisting\ntechnology in iterative ways. The step-counting and sleep-tracking are the\nsame. The heart rate sensors are the same, though Fitbit says it is constantly\nimproving its heart rate sensing technology. Two of these wristbands now have\n\"connected GPS,\" but in my experience with the Charge 2, that didn\u2019t mean it\nwas more accurate.  \n  \nIS AN ACCURATE TRACKER TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?  \n  \nFitbit says bug fixes are coming to the Charge 2, which just started shipping,\nand that those bug fixes will help it do one of the basic things it\u2019s supposed\nto do, which is track your distances traveled. And therein lies the rub: in\nthe world of constant software updates, firmware updates, and bug fixes,\nyou\u2019re supposed to be patient and wait it out (and give more of your personal\ndata over, while you\u2019re at it). Call me crazy, but that seems like an unfair\nbargain.\n\n", "The Charge 2 Fitbit tracker has problem synching and the wireless firmware\nupgrades are anything but smooth. For firmware upgrades, I miss the wired\nconnection to the laptop that the old fitbit flex used to have.The band\noffered with the tracker is a major disappointment. It peels over a period of\ntime and the replacements sent also peel within a matter of months. In spite\nof repeated complaints from the customers, the issue has not been fixed,\nalthough Fitbit has acknowledged long back that this is a problem and they are\naware of it. Google \"Charge 2 band peeling\" for more info.The biggest question\nis the design life of the fitbit trackers. The fitbit trackers have built-in,\nnon-replaceable rechargeable battery, and in my experience it completely fails\nwithin 2 years time. By that time, the 1 year warranty has lapsed, and there\nhence no replacement is offered. So think of spending all this money for just\n2 years of product life: That sucks!\n\n", "Horrible experience buying the first and definitely the last Fitbit product.\nWhen I bought the Charge 2, I was confused between two devices, Apple Watch S1\nand this dreadful Charge 2. I decided to save Rs. 9,000 and buy the latter.\nAnd that was undoubtedly one of my life's biggest mistakes.  \n  \nThe device is good when you just bought it, in fact, great on day 1 or 2. But\nthen you start noticing how easily the device gets scratched. Not just the\nscreen but also the body. In my case, it happened in just two weeks!!! In two\nweeks I found out that Rs.10,000 have gone down to complete waste. I regret\nnot going for Apple Watch now!  \n  \nI have worn many mid-range (Priced 10k to 20k) watches, apart from that\nMotorola Moto 360 Smartwatch and several wearables including Xioami and GOQii.\nI know how to handle and care for my wrist-wear and still, the Charge 2\nsustained scratches easily. Not that I have mindfully bumped into something or\nbrushed against the wall or something, which I would notice.  \n  \nTo my surprise when I checked the web for screen's reputation, I found out\n80-90% of the people reported screen damage (Scrateches, dents, and breaking)\nwithin the first 2 months!!!  \n  \nSo to summarize, the device is great for fitness and gives you detailed\nanalysis, so technically it is capable. But .... it won't last more than few\nmonths.

So it\u2019s not surprising Fitbit has taken everything that\nproved popular on the original and used this as a basis for the Charge 2,\nwhich was recently introduced alongside the new entry-level Fitbit Flex 2.  \n  \nFirst off, the heart rate monitoring of the Charge HR now comes as standard,\nso there\u2019s just one model of Charge 2. This helps bring down the sheer number\nof Fitbit trackers available, which was becoming confusing. The PurePulse\nheart rate monitor of the original makes a return, and brings with it\ncontinuous and resting heart rate monitoring.  \n  \nPacked with everything you could want, except GPS, the Charge 2 covers all of\nthe basics. You can consider this device more of an evolution than a\nreinvention, but by correcting many of the shortcomings of the original, the\nCharge 2 proves to be a great all-rounder.  \n  \n\ud83d\udc49Fitbit Charge 2 \u2013 Design and Setup  \nThe main change with the Fitbit Charge 2 is its more sizeable display \u2013 it\u2019s\nfour times larger, in fact. This means significantly more at-a-glance\ninformation and better handling of notifications from your connected\nsmartphone. The original Charge had only a tiny slither of a screen,\ndisplaying one metric at a time.  \n  \nIt uses a black-and-white OLED, and you can adjust the brightness; I never\nexperienced any problems reading the screen outdoors. The display turns on\nwhen you rotate your wrist to look at it, helping to conserve battery life.  \n  \nAnnoyingly, maybe one in four times the display failed to turn on\nautomatically. There is a button on the side to manually turn it on and toggle\nthrough the different displays, but for times when your other hand is\noccupied, the finicky display is a frustration.  \n  \nEach of the menus has a number of sub-menus that you access by tapping the\nscreen. Again, this was occasionally a little hit and miss. You need quite a\nfirm rapping of the display to get it to trigger.  \n  \nOtherwise, the Charge 2 isn\u2019t a great departure from its original design,\naside from being slightly more slender. The elastomer strap is comfortable to\nwear and since it uses a standard watch buckle, putting it on isn\u2019t fiddly \u2013\nunlike some previous Fitbit trackers that used difficult clasps. I didn\u2019t\nencounter any discomfort with it on, even when I became particularly sweaty\nduring a run.  \n  \nWhere the Charge 2 does deviate from previous models is in its potential for\ncustomisation. Much like the new Flex 2, you now have the ability to change\nthe bands. Fitbit has Classic, Luxe leather and Special Edition options.\nThere\u2019s an array of colours available, too, and the Special Edition versions\nhave rose gold and gunmetal finishes for the tracker itself to add another\nlayer of class and sophistication. These cost a little more (\u00a3149.99) than the\nstandard editions, though.  \n  \nI was sent the standard black elastomer band version for review. I definitely\nprefer some of the more vibrant colour options I saw in the flesh at IFA.\nSwapping out the bands is incredibly easy thanks to release clasps on the\nunderside. You can swap them out within seconds. The Fitbit Charge 2 is\navailable in three different strap sizes; small, large and XL. It\u2019s important\nto choose the right size for your wrist for reasons I\u2019ll come to later.  \n  \nThe Charge 2 works with Fitbit\u2019s Android and iOS app, and setting it up is as\nstraightforward as any other tracker. Simply create a profile, entering your\ngender, height and weight, then select a number of goals. These include the\nusual steps, sleep and weight targets.  \n  \nOnce paired over Bluetooth, you can then sync your activity to the app and\nreceive rudimentary notifications from your connected smartphone. These only\ninclude caller ID, messages and calendar reminders.  \n  \nOriginally, the Fitbit Charge 2 could only display SMS messages. I can\u2019t\nremember the last time I received a standard SMS message from anyone that\nwasn\u2019t a marketer, so how useful you\u2019ll find this is questionable.  \n  \nThankfully, a recent update to the Fitbit app now allows message notifications\nacross different apps, such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. This makes the\nfunction much more useful and is a very welcome update. There\u2019s still no way\nto interact with the message, and notifications for WhatsApp don\u2019t scroll the\nmessage, but you can at least see the message sender. It helps you to decide\nif it\u2019s worth whipping your phone out.  \n  \n\ud83d\udc49Activity Tracking  \nAs you\u2019d expect, the Charge 2 has the usual all-day activity and sleep\ntracking with silent alarm. Slightly disappointingly, it isn\u2019t a smart alarm\nthat can wake you up at a more optimal time. The Charge 2 can begin\nautomatically tracking selected sports and exercises such as hiking, cycling\nand, of course, running. Otherwise, you can trigger these from the button on\nthe side.  \n  \nWithout the waterproofing seen on the new Flex 2, swimming is a no-go \u2013 which\nis a shame. There\u2019s also no built-in GPS, but if you do go for a run with your\nsmartphone paired, the Charge 2 can use connected GPS for tracking distance\nand routes. You don\u2019t need to trigger the run from the app, either. Just start\nrunning and it will track in the background, or use the Charge 2 to manually\nstart the run if you want running metrics on the display. GPS information will\nautomatically get pulled in.  \n  \nI took the Charge 2 for a number of test runs, including running the same\nroute back-to-back \u2013 once with connected GPS and once without. The real\nsurprise was the margin of error between the results. The first GPS-connected\nroute was recorded at 2.64km, while the run sans smartphone came up at 2.65km.\nThat was impressive considering accelerometer-based tracking can be\nsignificantly off the mark.  \n  \nHowever, distance even with the connected GPS seemed to sell me short. I\u2019ve\nrun this route a number of times before using Strava and the GPS in my Huawei\nP9, and it\u2019s typically recorded at around 2.85 to 2.9km. This distance was\nconfirmed by the GPS built into the TomTom Spark 3 I wore simultaneously,\nwhich measured each run at around 2.9km.  \n  \nAs an aside, a Jawbone UP3 I wore put both runs at a combined 5.79km distance\n\u2013 unfortunately, it didn\u2019t split the two laps. As I literally sat on my\ndoorstep sweating profusely between the two runs, I can add the two distances\nfrom the Charge 2 together without much discrepancy. So this compared to the\n5.29km total from the Charge 2 confirms it does come up short and shows how\naccurate the Jawbone UP3 is.  \n  \nIt\u2019s worth noting that I was using an Honor 8 Android smartphone this time\naround during testing. Because I\u2019m a glutton for punishment, I decided to\nconduct the test again to see if the discrepancy was caused by the GPS in the\nHonor 8. I\u2019ve found various phones have tracked distances differently, even\nthrough GPS \u2013 and this was confirmed. I ran again, this time with Strava using\nmy phone\u2019s GPS, the Fitbit Charge 2 using connected GPS, and the TomTom Spark\n3.  \n  \nBoth Strava and the Charge 2 now reported the first route as 3.3km \u2013 over-\ntracking the distance. The TomTom Spark 3 was once again more accurate,\nfactoring in any deviations on the route to avoid obstacles, at 2.93km.  \n  \nI then ran the route again with my smartphone turned off, so no connected GPS\nfrom the Fitbit Charge 2. This time, it tracked the distance at 2.86km, so\ncloser to a truer result. It shows that an inaccurate GPS sensor can throw off\nyour results, which is why I generally prefer to have GPS built directly into\nthe running device. It will ensure greater consistency, even if you change\nyour phone.  \n  \nAs for basic step-counting, the Fitbit Charge 2 appeared to be quite generous\nwith steps, counter to what I found for distance. It averaged around 500 steps\nmore per day than the Jawbone UP3, and around 800 more than a Samsung Gear S2.  \n  \nAll manufacturers use slightly different algorithms for detecting actual steps\nand to make sure it\u2019s not just you flailing your arms around. So it\u2019s more\nabout consistency, and in this regard the difference between trackers was at\nleast generally the same between days.  \n  \nI was told by a Fitbit ambassador that the Charge 2 actually uses a barometric\nsensor to calculate its steps by tracking changes in pressure. That\u2019s an\ninteresting approach of which I wasn\u2019t aware, and also explains the lack of\ntrue waterproofing; there\u2019s a small hole for the sensor on the underside of\nthe tracker.  \n  \nThe Charge 2 has been improved over the original in that there are now move\nalerts. Since the release of the original, move alerts have become a basic\ninclusion with rival trackers, so I\u2019m pleased to see its presence.  \n  \nThe Charge 2 will detect when you\u2019ve been idle during a set time window \u2013 say,\nyour working hours when you\u2019re sat at a desk \u2013 and then provide a vibration to\ntell you to get up and take a walk. This will happen 10 minutes before the\nhour if you\u2019ve not taken 250 steps in the past 60 minutes. You\u2019ll receive a\nmotivational message on the display, too, and it\u2019s a surprisingly handy\nprompt.  \n  \nAlongside the 3-axis accelerometer there\u2019s also an altimeter, so you get a\nrecord of the number of floors you\u2019ve climbed. It\u2019s a small touch, but one\nthat can prompt you to take the stairs in lieu of the lift more often. When\nmotivation is what makes or breaks an activity tracker, it\u2019s the little things\nthat add up.  \n  \nAs for the PurePulse optical heart rate tracker on the rear of the device, I\ntested this against the Wahoo Fitness Tickr X chest-based HRM and the wrist-\nbased optical HRM from a TomTom Spark 3. Pre-run, the Charge 2 initially put\nmy heart rate around 10 BPM above both the Tickr X and TomTom Spark 3.  \n  \nPost-run, this was the case as well. The Charge 2 gave me a 144 BPM read out\nversus 134 BPM and 135 BPM from the Tickr X and Spark 3, respectively.\nStrangely, the Charge 2\u2019s heart rate reading then plummeted briefly to 60 BPM,\nwhile I assume it struggled to get a proper reading before eventually finding\nit again. At this point, all three heart rate monitors levelled out at a 120\nBPM post-run reading.  \n  \nFitbit says that \u201clike all heart rate tracking technologies, accuracy is\naffected by physiology, location of device and different movements\u201d. I\nmentioned earlier that the Charge 2 is available in different sizes. I was\ninitially sent a large size, which, while not ridiculously loose, wasn\u2019t quite\nas tight as I\u2019d have liked \u2013 even on the smallest hole. I have very slender\nwrists. To protect my ego I\u2019ll say that I can still bench two plates even with\nthis disadvantage.  \n  \nFitbit replaced my strap for a smaller model and this improved the heart rate\nreading while running, since this is where you\u2019ll want a snugger fit. It meant\nthat on my second set of test runs, there was less difference between the two\nlaps I ran. Still, the Charge 2 was basically as prone to deviations as I\u2019ve\ncome to expect from most optical HRMs, where they typically struggle with\ncontinuous readings during intense exercise. Typically, a chest-worn HRM will\nhave a greater sampling rate, meaning it takes readings at much shorter\nintervals for accuracy.  \n  \nThe Charge 2 does better taking resting heart rate measurements throughout the\nday and while you sleep, and this has always been a good indication of your\ncardiovascular health. It\u2019s a metric you can track over time, so as you aim to\nbecome fitter, you can track your resting heart rate decreasing as your\ncardiovascular system works more efficiently.  \n  \nI\u2019ve now been using the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few months, and being able to\nsee how my resting heart rate has changed based on my training programme is a\nuseful insight. I\u2019ve (intentionally) put on some weight in a bid to pack on\nmore muscle, but as a side effect, I can see that my resting heart rate has\nincreased from around 54 BPM to around 58-59 BPM. It shows to me that I should\nperhaps think about increasing my supplementary cardiovascular training.  \n  \nYou can also use the optical HRM for other exercise activities such as\nweightlifting or cycling, which you can trigger from the tracker itself. The\nresults page is broken down into Heart Rate, Calories and Impact tabs. The\nCharge 2 told me that an hour-long weights session kept me in the \u201cFat Burn\u201d\nzone throughout, burning 426 calories, and also contributed 1,616 steps to my\nday.  \n  \nNew with the Charge 2 is a VO2 max approximation to provide what Fitbit is\ncalling your \u201cCardio Fitness\u201d level. This is the maximum amount of oxygen your\nbody uses during intense exercise and is another good indicator of your\noverall cardiovascular health. Fitbit calculates this by comparing your\npersonal data against your running speed while using connected GPS and your\nheart rate measurements. Your score is provided against other people from your\ngender and age.  \n  \nI actually found my Cardio Fitness score became slightly worse after my\ninitial test run. This was most likely due to the anomalous heart rate\nreadings that put it higher, and therefore more inefficient, than what the\nother HRM sensors I wore were reporting. The second lap in particular was\nquite a bit off.  \n  \nWithout accurate continuous heart rate tracking, the Cardio Fitness score\nwon\u2019t be as accurate. The second set of test runs, with the tighter strap,\nprovided more accurate results and put my Cardio Fitness score back above 60.\nI\u2019m proud to say that this puts me at \u201cExcellent\u201d for my gender and age. It\nwon\u2019t ever be as accurate as a true VO2 Max test, but in fairness, a proper\nVO2 test is a far more complicated and expensive process that wouldn\u2019t be\navailable to many.  \n  \nIt isn\u2019t all about intense exercise, though. A Breathe mode takes you through\nguided breathing exercises. A circle pulsates on the screen to show when to\ninhale and exhale, and you can choose different durations. It uses your heart\nrate and adjusts itself accordingly to get you in a more relaxed state. There\nare two- and five-minute durations. Mildly annoyingly, there\u2019s no way of\ncancelling one mid-way, so if you start one you\u2019re going to need to follow\nthrough.  \n  \nThis feature isn\u2019t drastically different to what you\u2019ll see in the forthcoming\nwatchOS 3 update for the Apple Watch although the implementation on the Apple\nWatch is more elegant. The Apple Watch uses haptic feedback to help you time\nyour breathing, whereas you need to stare at the Fitbit Charge 2\u2019s screen. How\nuseful you\u2019ll find the Breathe mode remains to be seen \u2013 we all know how to\nbreathe, after all \u2013 but it could be a nice primer to just take it easy every\nnow and then.  \n  \nThe Charge 2\u2019s sleep tracking is an interesting one. It gives you a time\n\u201casleep\u201d, which is the time you spent \u201cawake\u201d and \u201crestless\u201d, subtracted from\nyour overall tracked sleeping time. It means that while you might have \u201cslept\u201d\nfor eight hours, the \u201ctime asleep\u201d reading on the dashboard might only read\n2hrs 42mins. It\u2019s worth keeping this in mind before assuming that the device\nisn\u2019t tracking your sleep correctly.  \n  \nI think this is actually a better, and less misleading, measurement than the\noverall \u201csleeping time\u201d that other trackers and sports watches offer. It can\nshow you why, even though you\u2019re getting your target hours of sleep, you\u2019re\nwaking up fatigued and weary come morning. Really it\u2019s the quality of asleep\nalongside duration that\u2019s important for appropriate recovery and well-being.  \n  \nIn my case, with the sleep graph produced by the Charge 2, everything lined up\nas expected. This included the times I\u2019m woken by the neighbourhood urban\nfoxes who sit in the middle of the road and yelp incessantly for absolutely no\nreason.  \n  \n\ud83d\udc49Fitbit Charge 2 \u2013 App and Guidance  \n  \nOver the years, I\u2019ve worn a whole raft of Fitbit trackers and so have seen\nmany of the changes that the app has undergone. One area the company should be\napplauded for is updating its app with new features and improving the\ninterface. It\u2019s really evolved over time to be clearer and now provides far\nmore engaging features  \n  \nThe dashboard provides plenty of at-a-glance information on your day, from the\ntime asleep as mentioned above, to floors climbed, steps taken and distance\ncovered. You can jump into each sub-menu for more detailed information, with\neverything logically laid out. The Cardio Fitness score is tucked away behind\nthe heart rate reading, for instance, and the continuous heart rate readings\ngraph is easy to understand.  \n  \nThere are also areas where it\u2019s possible to log your food and water intake;\nuseful if you want to have an overview of everything from activity to\nnutrition as well.  \n  \nNew to a recent update are Adventures, which are found under the Challenges\nmenu. These are virtual tours of famous locations, such as Yosemite National\nPark. By getting in extra steps, you unlock content along the route, including\nfacts and photographs of landmarks that you can view using the gyroscope in\nyour phone.  \n  \nIt\u2019s a nice touch, and gives you the extra impetus to be more active. They\u2019re\nparticularly great if you don\u2019t like the idea of competing against friends,\nbut would rather do something on your own.  \n  \nThere are, of course, the standard leaderboard challenges if you do want to go\nstep-for-step with friends. You can opt into day challenges or longer ones,\nsuch as Workweek Hustle. You receive updates towards the target in a timeline,\nso you can see how you and your friends are doing.  \n  \nYou can also \u201cCheer\u201d the updates, similar to a \u201cLike\u201d on Facebook. It\u2019s a nice\nsocial element. There\u2019s also a 7-day steps leaderboard, so you can see how you\ncompare over time.  \n  \nIf there\u2019s one complaint about the app, for me it\u2019s the lack of guidance. I\u2019d\nlove for Fitbit to take a leaf out of Jawbone\u2019s book with its Smart Coach\nfeature, which lets you know how all of the data can affect your wellbeing and\nhealth. It provides useful prompts \u2013 such as staying better hydrated, or\nexplaining how going to sleep 30 minutes earlier might have a positive impact,\nthen offering to set you a sleep reminder.  \nYou do get the occasional notification to tell you how well you\u2019re progressing\ntowards your goal, but actually having this in the dashboard would be better,\nsince it\u2019s easy to ignore or dismiss the notifications. You can opt into\nweekly progress emails as well.  \n\ud83d\udc49Fitbit Charge 2 \u2013 Battery Life and Charging  \nBattery life is rated at around five days, which is about right. A major\nimprovement over the old Fitbit Charge is the new \u201cclamp-style\u201d USB charging\ncable. This locks around the tracker on both sides and makes orientating it\nmuch easier, ensuring it stays connected. The old Charge had a connector that\nplugged in directly and therefore could easily become dislodged. You\u2019ll get a\nnotification and an e-mail to let you know the Charge 2 is running low on\nbattery.  \n  \n\ud83d\udc49Should I buy the Fitbit Charge 2?  \nThe distance, step counting and heart rate measurements, while perhaps not the\nmost accurate, are consistent enough to prove useful. Combined, they do give\nyou a measurable way to track your progress. The new Cardio Fitness score,\ntoo, is a useful metric. The Fitbit app has also come on leaps and bounds in\nproviding motivation, but there remain areas where it can be improved.  \n  \nThere\u2019s nothing really revolutionary about the Fitbit Charge 2. It\u2019s very much\nan evolution of the Charge where styling has taken centre stage. The new\ncustomisation options will appeal to the sartorially inclined, but potentially\nthere aren\u2019t enough new features to make it a must-have upgrade if you have\nthe old model. Especially since the Breathe mode feels like a gimmick.  \n  \nThe real disappointment is the lack of waterproofing. The Charge 2 is only\nwater-resistant, unlike the other new Fitbit addition, the Flex 2. So while\nyou can wash your hands wearing it, you definitely can\u2019t go swimming with it\non. You\u2019ll have to take it off to shower as well, which can prove disruptive.\nIdeally, a fitness tracker is something you want to put on and only ever take\noff to charge. Every time you take one off is one more chance you\u2019ll forget to\nput it back on, nullifying its purpose.  \n  \nConnected GPS is an improvement over the old Charge and Charge HR, but it\u2019s\nstill not an ideal replacement for a dedicate GPS sensor built directly into\nthe tracker.  \n  \nA wearable such as the Fitbit Charge 2 will never be able to compete on\naccuracy, especially against expensive tests such as a VO2 Max. What you\u2019re\ninstead looking for is reliability, and this is where the Charge 2 does well.\nIn the end, if you want a HRM-equipped everyday fitness tracker that you can\ndress up or down, the Fitbit Charge 2 is still a good all-rounder.  \n  \nVerdict  \nThe Fitbit Charge 2 is an improvement over the original, but it doesn\u2019t really\nbring a whole lot new to your wrist.  \n  \n\ud83d\udd34Guys!

Whatever might\nbe the reason, this is unacceptable and should be investigated.  \nAttaching the images here for proof!!  \nFitbit Charge 2 Wireless Activity Tracker and Sleep Wristband (Large,\nPlum/Silver)\n\n", "Update: After nearly a month of use -  \n1) Battery life: I charge the tracker once a week. Lasts 6 days at least on a\nsingle charge. If you don't have UL certified charger, use USB port of your\nlaptop to charge - this will ensure battery is not stressed.  \n2) Auto exercise tracking is spot on. But I ensure to start exercise recording\non the tracker manually  \n3) Sleep tracking couple of times did not record sleep stages but simply\nlogged number of hours slept. Don't know what the issue was but it worked fine\nthe next night.  \n4) Quick View feature should have an auto turn off option - the tracker\notherwise blinds you when sleeping if the screen accidentally turns on. There\nshould be a schedule for automatically turning Quick View off at night between\na defined time period. People have already requested this feature on Fitbit\nforum. Let's hope this is implemented soon.  \n\\----------------------------------------------------  \nNovelty! I was in two minds to go for either this or Alta, especially since I\ndidn't want to look like a nerd and hence style was of essence. Charge 2 all\nthe way. This is an awesome device. Blue color is nice - goes well with formal\nas well as casual attire. Black I felt will lead to a nerdy look. Tracking is\npretty accurate - love all the stats that one can play with. Had it for all of\ntwo days and simply love it.  \nDownloaded the fitbit app on my phone and started the setup and immediately\nreceived an OTA. Post install, fitbit got configured.  \nI use the following :  \n1) Step tracking - results are close enough to my phone's step count - NOT\nusing connected gps  \n2) Workout mode - treadmill and weight training. This throws up an insane\namount of data - actually nice to dive into the stats and track progress. To\nturn on, navigate to workout and then tap the screen to select appropriate\nworkout mode and start by long pressing the button on the side  \n3) Sleep tracking - Tell sleep stages - and over time I hope to improve my\nsleep duration and cycle  \n4) Quick view - Have turned this ON - just turn your wrist (rotation should be\nof 'sufficient' amount for this to work) - not a flick but rotation of wrist\nas you move your wrist towards your face. Screen will automatically light up.\nYou can then navigate through the menu if you wish to by either the push of\nthe button or tapping the screen (actually tapping anywhere on the screen with\na certain 'momentum' - seems this feature relies on gyroscope to work and it\nis NOT detecting any tap/pressure point etc.  \n5) Notifications - You will need to keep phone's Bluetooth always ON for this\nto work. Location (a mandatory feature to be turned ON to sync the band) can\nbe turned OFF  \na) Messages - Love the fact that you can read messages as they arrive - Charge\n2 vibrates and just turn your wrist to turn on the screen and read the message\n- it will auto scroll. You can't go back to the message but is quick and\nefficient - no need to take out the phone for pesky forwards and never miss\n(read delay in replying) to your better half ;)  \nYou need to configure which messaging app can fitbit access and hence display\nmessages from - unfortunately only one app can be chosen  \nb) Receive call notifications on the band - again it vibrates and displays the\ncaller's name (and 'Unknown' in case the no. is not saved in your phone's\ncontact list  \n5) Silent alarm is also a nice feature. Have configured one on my fitbit to\nmatch the one I put on phone. The fitbit vibrated twice on alarm and would\nsnooze automatically if you don't press the button on the side. Snooze\nduration is 9mins and can't be changed. The alarm feature ensures I am up on\ntime with two devices on vibration - one next to my pillow (my phone) and one\non my wrist (fitbit)  \n6) I have also configured the order of menu - like i) enabling battery\nindicator and bringing it up the order so that I can check the battery level\nwith fewer pushes of the button, and ii) removed assisted breathing  \nFurther points to ponder:  \nA) Battery seems to last 5 days as claimed - at 67% after two days with one\nday of fiddling with the new band :D  \nB) Buy a screen protector. Read that the screen is plastic and hence scratches\neasily  \nC) Bought a small size. Use the Charge 2 measuring assist available online as\na PDF. Take its print and cut out the band and measure your wrist to know the\ncorrect for you  \nD) If you are looking for a replacement band - all the best. Can't find any\nreasonable priced ones. Official one cost a bomb at Rs.1,799\n\n", "I am shocked to see the people crying, complaining and bickering over the\nprice.  \n1\\. It is the best fitness tracker to be launched by fitbit till date; and\nprobably will be top of the line for a long time to come.  \n2\\. It is the same price as the fitbit charge hr so I don't know what everyone\nis complaining about since quite a few useful new features have been added\nalong with the increased screen size.  \n3\\. For people comparing the price to the US price of $149 which comes to\naround Rs 10,000, please note that the additional price you are paying here is\non account of shipping, handling, import duty and many such miscellaneous\ncharges as this product is imported and not manufactured in India.  \n4\\. Even if you are purchasing it in the USA, consider your travel costs to\npurchase it. If someone else is sending it for you, you still have to pay\nshipping unless your getting that for free.  \n5\\. It is a brilliant tracker and stop giving it 1 star reviews just for the\nprice, lets talk about the performance and features!\n\n", "The tracker works fine and the interface on the app provides enough data and\ntrends to monitor parameters like pulse, calories burnt, sleep and VOX2\nchanges. It certainly helps in keeping track of the progress and provides a\nbit of motivation to do better than the last day or last week. The battery is\ngood and lasts almost a week ( I did not activate the notifications)  \nThe pedometer is fairly accurate and counts the steps well. So is the\nstaircase climb counter.  \n  \nNow the bad-  \nThe heart rate monitoring is more or less accurate in the heart rate range 65-\n90. The variation I found when checked with a pulse oxymeter was 3 -4 which I\nthink is fairly OK. When the pulse is above that - the tracker shows more than\n120, the error in measurement is very high to the tune of inaccurate. I found\na variation of 20 beats plus variation. Then, this is not a medical device but\nonly a tracker.  \nThe pulse monitor has the annoying habit of not showing any value in the\nmiddle of a run. You shake it a few ties or take it out and put it back on and\nthe reading comes back. This is an irritant rather than a flaw.  \nI have been using the tracker since last 45 days and suddenly the tracker\ndecided not to sync with the app. This practically makes it useless and the\ntracker became a digital watch. From the Fitbit forum, one can see there are a\nnumber of users with this problem. I had contacted Fitbit and they had asked\nme to send the tracker to their agent in Delhi and on receiving it, they will\nsend a replacement in 15 day's time. In terms of customer handling, the\ncustomer support is good. They reply to the mail within 3- 4 hours.  \nThe app ( I use an android phone) decides not to connect to the server and\ngives the error - invalid password. After multiple tries, the app connects.\nAgain, this issue is also common - many posts in the fitbit forums.  \n  \nThe tracker and the app are not error free and has their own share of issues\nand the solutions to the issues are not there at the moment. Getting\nreplacement is good, but whether this will happen every time or every case is\ndoubtful.

The FitBit app is a great\nportal to log your calorie intake, your weight loss (or gain) goals, your\nother fitness goals.

Thanks to the step count and reminders  \n\\- I have stopped watching TV at least 20-30 minutes before I wind down to\nsleep, after I noticed that my resting heart rates were lower when I had a\nsmall interval between tv and sleep time  \n\\- I triggered a change in my mattress after noticing sleep patterns differ\nbetween hotels and home. This helped improve sleep quality as well.  \n\\- I drink more water now and keep a log  \n\\- I take the stairs far more often and check if I do ten floors every day  \n\\- I do more deep breathing during the weekdays after I noticed that resting\nheart rates dipped over the weekend, indicating better relaxation!  \n  \nAltogether, the device and app pair is a great tool to make you more conscious\nabout little habits that affect your health in small but meaningful ways.

I think we are at a point where universal chargers are common sense but\nsadly not the reality. This comes with proprietary charger so if you lose it\nor break it you have to buy one from fitbit again.  \n2\\. The wrist motion that wakes up the screen doesn't turn itself off even\nafter the band detects you are sleeping. I am a light sleeper and was woken up\nseveral times because of light suddenly flashing in my eyes so finally had to\ndisable it. There's no option to do this via the band, can only be done\nthrough the app so I just turned it off completely.  \n3\\. The tap feature to move down the menu is a little flaky. Not a fan. And\nyou can only go down the menu not up.  \n4\\. The distance counter is off a good 200-300m for every km. My treadmill\nshows I have walked 2km but fitbit will show only 1.6km walked.  \nPros:  \n1\\. The band is more rounded than all other bands available at this price.  \n2\\. These guys have been in the game long enough and know what is expected. As\na result their app is really good. Very user friendly, very intuitive. Syncs\nwell. You can compete against your friends and win challenges, set up goals\netc. This is a major motivating factor for me.  \n3\\. Movement reminder urges you to walk every hour. Definitely made me more\nactive.  \n4\\. HRM is fairly accurate. First thing to know in this area is that no wrist\nHRM is very accurate at this point, but fitbit band does the job.\n\n", "For the price, and the features advertised, this is a poor product. Build is\nnowhere near to justify its price. the screen is plastic instead of glass and\na gentle breeze would leave a scratch on this poor product. It DOES NOT detect\nexercises automatically. You can forget about accurate step counting if you\nhave long commutes to work. There is no intelligent removal of steps while\ntraveling. That's something a cheap phone with google fit accomplishes with\nease. The only things that work are the floors counted (doesnt exclude\naltitude changes during commute) and sleep tracking is more or less fine. The\ncontinuous HR sensing is the only thing you may consider this product for,\nwhich is also off by a fair margin when the BPM is over 150.  \nThe bottom line is that the price for this device cannot be justified in any\nway. Neither the build not the performance meets expectation. One is better\noff with a similarly poor performing device that is bought cheaper.\n\n", "Mi Band offer same details in one fifth of cost. Just the brand name. Simple\naspects like climbing floor or steps taken are incorrect. It even records, Ur\nmanual gearbox car drive in traffic as climbing stairs.

Don't waste too much money get a\ncheaper Mi band.\n\n", "It's perfect to keeps u active and it motivates to do the workout it's perfect\nfor everyone i had rashes on my wrist because of it but I always now sanitise\nit every day so it want happen again else it is just perfect perfect perfect\n\n", "It's good overall, 2 issues noticed in last 1 yr: wrist band is already gone\nand end up spending another Rs.900  \nSecond issue is tracking problem.

Second\nproblem shows lacks in functioning of Fitbit overall.\n\n", "Let me be clear, what I have, to compare with this, has been a lot. And this,\nin no way, has been a cheap purchase. To compare this with, I have an LG G\nwatch (the old, square face), a Moto 360, a 360 2nd Gen, an Apple watch sport,\na Firbit Charge HR and a Fitbit Flex.  \n  \nThis thing is so good at heart rate monitoring, it's ridiculous. But what bugs\nme is the most glaring omission of all. It doesn't calculate distance\nproperly, adds way too many steps and under counts steps once I'm actually out\non a walk. And I'm comparing this thing with all of the above. This thing\nsuc*s so bad, it contradicts itself! The fitbit app counts 1 kilometer in 10\nminutes and counts 7997 steps - through GPS. This count is by the app itself.\nThe same exact distance, I start an activity on the watch so it starts\nrecording me for that exact same kilometer when the GPS is on, and mind you,\nis connected to the smart band and it touts 'connected GPS', This thing\nrecords 5000 steps and 560 meters. How off can one thing be!?  \n  \nI've tried wearing on the dominant wrist, thereby altering the sensitivity;\nI've tried using the 'connected GPS' option with the phone screen ON and\nfitbit app in the foreground all the time, I've tried altering my stride\nmanually; all this, and this thing won't budge.  \n  \nI've had it. The apple watch and Fitbit Charge HR give me the same results, if\nnot a little worse as compared to GPS data, without me having to carry my\nphone along. Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I'm able to return this. No\nmore Fitbit products for me, most of all never this one. Manufacturers should\nknow what sh*t products they sell when they start taking these things back.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 5 February 2017", "on 7 December 2016", "on 6 December 2017", "on 2 March 2018", "on 6 November 2016", "on 15 December 2016", "on 23 September 2017", "on 19 June 2017", "on 8 January 2018", "on 17 October 2016"], "reviewer": ["Manddy", "Faisal Dilawar", "ashish", "Shah Jaydeep", "Mrudula Putcha", "Sameer singh", "Chris", "Amit", "Prethish", "Harneet Kalra"]},

It replaces the original best-selling\nCharge & Charge HR. Steps, Flights, Heart Rate, Calories Burned, Connected GPS\n(shows a little map post workout when tied to your phone, and yes, you need to\nbring your phone with you on walks/runs), and notifications (as of now, just\ntexts, calendar alerts, and displays phone number of incoming calls). Great\nintro watch/tracker to be your first Fitbit. Does pretty much everything. Yes\nthere are other trackers out there, and some cheaper (in some you get what you\npay for). What separates Fitbit is the software and social functions. You\nwon't find a better app with ease of use, not to mention with the largest\nuserbase of trackers it's much easier to find friends and families to\nparticipate in challenges. Read on if you want to know some of the features.  \n  \nPart Two: If You've Owned A Charge/Charge HR, and should you upgrade?  \n  \nThe Charge watch has been the workhorse of the Fitbit line. Worth getting a\nCharge 2? In a word: YES. Since you're familiar with the Charge already, let's\ngo over some of the issues you may have experienced and highlights/common\nquestions answered:  \n  \n1) Build Quality: The Charge 2 is a far far superior quality than the original\nCharge. Right out of the box, you'll notice how much sturdier and thicker the\nband feels.  \n  \n2) Swapping out bands is relatively easy. Once you figure out how to press on\nthe band on each side to release, it's fairly painless. I could see someone\nelderly struggling with it at first. **If you had problems with your original\nCharge band bubbling, the ability to swap bands and how the tracker is\nconnected to the bands should eliminate the issues you have experienced **\nObviously way too early to make a call on how the device will hold up, but\ngiven my experience with Blaze & Alta, this feels similar in build quality, if\nnot better, and neither of those devices have suffered from bands falling\napart on a wide scale.  \n  \n3) Width of the device is nearly identical to the original Charge/HR. The\nbutton on the left side of the device is much more pronounced (good thing).\nYou can give it a nice firm click, and it doesn't feel loose or cheap as some\nof the Charge buttons were prone to.  \n  \n4) SIZING: The band itself is much longer than the original. I have always\nworn small in fitbit products, and found myself almost on the last hole.\nSomething to keep in mind if you think you are on the cusp of small/large.\nSmall likely the way to go.  \n  \n5) Display is nice, 4x larger than the original Charge. The font is displayed\ncrystal clear, and is very bright. Can see it extremely well, even in bright\nsunlight. It is NOT a color screen. The font is a bright offwhite, as opposed\nto the original Charge that had a soft almost blue to it. Texts when incoming\nscroll across the screen.  \n  \n6) Overall look is sharp. Much better looking than the original. Very sleek\nand elegant. Actually looks better than the Blaze given thinner profile.  \n  \n7) Has a breathing/relaxation function. Have only dabbled with this. It\nactually monitors as you inhale and exhale and prompts you when to take deep\nbreaths, etc. More of a gimmick to me, but some may find this useful.  \n  \n8) Navigation is relatively easy. When selecting specific workouts (you can\ncustomize the list in app), you hit the button on the side to get to the\nworkout screen, then tap to cycle through them (run, weights, treadmill,\nelliptical, etc). Hold the button and your workout starts. During the workout\nyou can cycle through metrics specific to your activity such as calories\nburned, heart rate, etc. Some activities will display steps, pace,calories\nburned, etc.  \n  \n9) Menu items start with your clock face, then by pressing the button will\ndisplay Heart Rate, Exercise, Stopwatch, Relax, and Alarm.  \n  \n10) Clock Faces: There are seven to choose from. Some display day & date, and\nmost have the option to where when you tap the display it will cycle through\nstats (may display heart rate, date, steps taken, how far you are in your\ngoals, your hourly movement reminders, etc). BUT DOES IT HAVE SECONDS? Yes,\ntwo of the watch faces are digital (numbers display, not hands) and have\nseconds displayed. There is only one \"classic\" watch face with the hands, and\nno that one does not display the second hand.  \n  \n11) Notifications: You get basic texts (no pictures of course), both SMS &\nWhatsApp message. Incoming calls will display the contact and/or phone number.\nAnd you get calendar alerts. There is no 3rd party support at this time such\nas Facebook, Instagram, etc (The Blaze watch will be offering these soon in\nnext software upgrade, so I guess there is hope the Charge 2 will get those as\nwell).  \n  \n12) Reminders to Move: Sit on your butt too long and it will thump you with a\nvibe (250 steps per hour).  \n  \nToday I put it through its first paces with a workout. I use it mostly for\nlight cardio and weights. Heart rate was spot on as it usually was with\noriginal Charge HR & my Blaze. No issues with step counting on the elliptical\nI used to warm it up. I have not used the watch for 24 hours yet, so have not\nbeen able to judge the VOX/Cardio Fitness Level rating new to this device.  \n  \nPROS:  \n\\- It is worth upgrading alone from the Charge/HR simply due to building\nquality. Pictures do not do it justice. As another poster on a forum where we\ndiscuss Fitbit devices said, it has that \"Apple\" quality feels to it. It no\nlonger feels like a cheap rubber tracker. The ability to swap to leather,\nmetal or other colored bands means you can wear this unit for any occasion if\nthe style is your thing. It really does look great.  \n\\- Monitoring of heart rate using optical sensors has never been a problem for\nme, and this one seems to be no different. Obviously, some folks have trouble\nwith them due to body hair and whatnot, but the sensors on Charge HR, Blaze,\nand now Charge 2 seem to be spot on. An issue I had with the original Charge\nwas it getting \"lost\" when I hit higher cardio levels. This doesn't appear to\nbe as much of an issue this time around. That said, this isn't a medical\ndevice, so I expect it to not be 100% all of the time. Use it as a tool in\nyour overall fitness profile.  \n\\- The charger itself is a new clip style (looks like a staple remover) and\nfits over the sides of the tracker. Fits nice and snug and snaps in. It won't\nfall out of the charge (actually think that's impossible given the design). No\nmore worrying about it not snapping on and falling off or getting it just\nright. Big improvement.  \n  \nCONS:  \n\\- vibration is notably weaker than the original Charge. May be an issue for\nsome using it as an alarm if you're a heavy sleeper. That said, I wore it very\ntight to bed last night, and it was able to wake me this morning (something\nI've had problems with on the Blaze from time to time).  \n\\- text notifications are neat if you've never had them. However, I have a\nBlaze, where you can see the whole message at once. The Charge HR slowly\nscrolls texts and notifications to you, which can be annoying if you're used\nto the Blaze. They serve their purpose well though, and I can't ding it for\nthis as it's a step up from the original Charge.  \n  \nVERDICT:  \nI reviewed it as if I were upgrading from the Charge/HR to this device. It is\na no-brainer if you've held on to your Charge/HR and not upgraded yet to the\nAlta or Blaze for whatever reason. I'd rank the Charge 2 ahead of the Alta. If\nmoney is no object, spend the extra to get the Blaze simply due to the color\ndisplay and easier navigation (not to mention ability to see full texts as\nthey come in). Otherwise, you'll be very happy to have moved up from other\nFitbit products. The Blaze is their high-end product at the moment, but the\nCharge 2 is a very close second.  \n  \nI'll happily answer questions as I did for when I originally reviewed the\nBlaze out of the gate, and edit this review to reflect common questions or any\nissues I face as I put the device through its paces in the coming days.\n\n", "Fitbit have marketed themselves over the years very well. Same cannot be said\nof their product (my first one).  \n  \nFitbit Charge 2 looks elegant with the right colour but is built off cheap\nmaterial (plastic!). I've used this for a month, even a minor touch against a\nwall leaves an ugly scratch on the display which is disappointing. The strap\nis tough enough, but, what would you do with a strap if your display is\nscrewed.  \n  \nThe activity tracker works ok, nothing great although you start to get\nfrustrated when it starts tracking your driving as \"steps\" which is\nridiculous. An activity tracker that costs > 10k should be smarter than this.  \n  \nHeart rate monitoring is done well and quite accurate, notifications don't\nwork well at all. I didn't receive call notifications, I had message\nnotifications coming in initially, but, I had turned it off, then, I turned it\nback on, and ever since, didn't receive any notifications!  \n  \nNot very sure about the exercise tracking since mostly I was into badminton\nand it never guessed that which is mostly the case with all the other\ntrackers.  \n  \nThe app as a whole is beautifully done with nice widgets and graphs. But the\nsyncing is too bad. It is advertised to be auto synced, but, that never\nhappened for me. I had to manually sync with the app every time which gets\nirritating over time!  \n  \nIf you are already on a smart watch, don't buy this. I made the mistake of\ngiving up Apple Watch and giving this a shot and was majorly disappointed.\nNow, I'm back using the Apple Watch.  \n  \nOverall, Fitbit Charge 2 is a major let down. If Fitbit want Apple's\ncustomers, they'll have to do way better than this.\n\n", "Great product and best one in terms of value for money among offered series\nfrom fitbit wrist band.It also comes with a best smooth pulse rate tracking\ninfo.Also it is spontaneously responding the smartphones which is connected\nwith it.Overall it is good and worthy fitbit ,supercool.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a.For more details\nplease check the below mentioned;  \nDescription:  \nMake every beat count with Fitbit Charge 2 - the all new heart rate and\nfitness wristband built for all-day, workouts and beyond.

Plus I don't know whom to contact for\nreplacement, I don't see anywhere phone number or E-maill address.\n\n", "This is my first experience with Fitbit and I love this product, except for\ntwo issues I have faced in the two of ownership.  \n  \n1\\. When you are travelling, the Fitbit counts the steps/stairs even when you\nare in a car or a bus. It keeps adding the corresponding badges too based on\nhow many steps your tracker counts while traveling. There is no way to reset\nor remove these badges and you loose the motivation immediately. There is no\nway to stop the Fitbit Charge 2 from counting steps/stairs while you are\ntraveling. You only have the option to negate the steps by adding the activity\n'Driving' from the online dashboard. But even this does not remove those\nbadges that were given to you by mistake. I have a whole bunch of badges to my\ncredit in 2 weeks, since I was on a road trip for 700kms (both ways) where it\ncounted 30000 steps, while I was sleeping in the bus.  \n  \n2\\. A couple of days ago, the Steps/Stairs/Distance/Active Minutes counters on\nthe tracker were reset to '0', every time I synced the tracker with my app.\nContacted customer service, they asked me to check the time zone on my\nphone/pc where the app was, but there was no issue with that. They couldn't\nprovide an answer at all and were beating around the bush. By then, it was the\nnext day and tracker was back to normal, even on synchronizing with the app.\nBut I lost the step/stair counts for the day and lost all the challenges I was\npart of because of that.  \n  \nAnyways, this is still a great device in many ways. I would still recommend\npeople to buy it after they read the pro's and con's below.  \n  \nPro's  \n1\\. Subtle device. You won't even feel you are wearing it.  \n2\\. Pulse Tracking, SMS and Call notifications, Steps, Stairs, Active Minutes,\nCalories Burned, Distance Covered, Exercise Tracking, Sports Tracking,\nBreathing Exercise and Stopwatch on your wrist (watch out for some con's\nrelated to these below).  \n3\\. Simple and easy to use GI for the app. I have used the app on Windows 10\nLaptop, Windows 10 Phone, Android 6.0 Phone and the even the online Web-\ninterface. Extremely user-friendly.  \n4\\. Prompt Customer service. You can reach @FitbitSupport on twitter and they\nrespond in decently quick time. And the best part is, if your device is\nfaulty, they give you a free replacement.  \n5\\. Excellent Fitbit Community. You will have a lot of people in your area who\nare already Fitbit users. You can challenge, add friends, etc. You get a lot\nof motivation because of this.  \n6\\. There are a lot of other apps that can be readily synced with Fitbit app.  \n  \nCons  \n1\\. The Call and SMS notifications are not available for Windows Phones till\nnow. Beta testing is underway and you may expect a first launch by June 2017.  \n2\\. There is absolutely no way you can turn off the tracker. The only way it\ncan turn off is when it runs out of battery. If you remove and keep it on\ntable, the tracker will assume you are sleeping and record your sleep. If you\nkeep it in a bag and travel, it will still continue to think you are walking.\nThere is no way to stop this. And the badges get added too, with no way of\nundoing this. You may negate the steps but you cannot remove those badges.  \n3\\. Some reports say that the step counts are exaggerated by about 20%. I am\nnot sure. But if you swing your arm while sitting in a chair, the tracker will\nstart counting.  \n  \nVerdict:  \nGood to buy product. But make sure you are aware of the negatives as well\nbefore you buy. Search the Fitbit community forums for more. At the end of the\nday, this may not be 100% accurate but it is definitely a great way to keep\nmotivating yourself. I lost close to 2 kilograms in 10 days, since I am able\nto keep track of my input and output.\n\n", "The strap is so bad.

It feels great\nusing this band. The quality is just too good, display is really good (pretty\ngood in sunlight), pedometer & heart rate monitor is really accurate. I wish i\nwas completely water proof, but it not. Its only splash proof. Guided\nbreathing works really well. Overall an excellent buy for this price range. Go\nfor it without a second thought.\n\n", "Used the device for few hours only to realise it counts every hand moments as\na step. I bought it for this purpose mainly.  \nYes sleep, water intake, heart rate works fine. However when i tried to match\nHR with BP machine it didn\u2019t match. Difference of 10.  \n  \nI may not be a expert in this, but these are my observations. Its upto you if\nsuch errors are in acceptable range or what? Maybe i\u2019m over expecting.\n\n", "i have been using fitbit charge HR for last 18 months, thought the charge 2 is\nan upgrade and ended up buying it. too many issues with synching, i have been\nin touch with the fitbit technical team and trust me it is a waste of time and\nthey give the same solution every single time. the sleep schedule does not\nsync or it syncs in an erratic manner. i am regretting my decision of buying\nthe FITBIT CHARGE 2. I WISH AMAZON TAKES IT BACK AND REFUNDS THE AMOUNT.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 18 July 2017", "on 16 June 2017", "on 22 October 2017", "on 6 October 2016", "on 23 September 2017", "on 9 September 2017", "on 26 December 2016", "on 5 October 2016", "on 22 September 2017", "on 2 November 2016"], "reviewer": ["Hitesh", "Anand", "Sandeep", "Dr. Yogin Soni", "PP", "Nilesh", "Parth yadav", "Ganesh Kamath", "Shubham Sachdeva", "Renu"]}
