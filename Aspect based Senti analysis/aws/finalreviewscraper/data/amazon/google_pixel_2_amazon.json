If you do not mind spending more than 60k on a phone\nwith (positives first) an awesome camera, and stellar developer support, but\n(now the negatives) dubious screen quality, almost zero after-sales service,\nand no headphone jack, this is it.  \n  \n=== The full review follows ===  \n  \nIf there are a few questions that need to be answered, among the top would be,\nwhat Google is thinking while making the phones. Google phones, if google\ndecides them to be, can be kings of the Android hill, but every single time,\nGoogle misses out on one thing or the other. And this time, it is the screen,\nand the removal of the headphone jack! It added waterproofing, improved on an\nalready awesome camera, and went back on the headphone jack.  \n  \n*** My Biggest Grouse ***  \nThe sound quality is supposedly awesome, but over the regular one thousand\nrupee bluetooth headsets, it was worse than it could have been. Using the\ndongle, the audio quality is stellar, but for someone like me who keeps using\npublic transport, and prefers pulling out the phone and shoving things into it\nblind, pairing a bluetooth headset blind is simply not my thing.  \n  \n*** My Next Biggest Grouse ***  \nBattery life. Why can Google not include a proper 4000Mah battery? With all\nthe wireless stuff going on, the battery lasts a day - but barely. Coming from\nsomething like the Motorola Z play, you cannot but be underwhelmed by\ngenerally decent but relatively sub-par battery life.  \n  \n** My Biggest Concern **  \nWhat if my screen cracks? What if my screen develops issues, like it seems to\nbe? I am not sure my problems will be resolved quickly. It is not as if I go\nto a store and get it replaced. I am not in the US! This would be my biggest\nreason to stay away. Awesome photos or not.\n\n", "Weird feature of capturing mirror images of Selfies.  \nOn top of it, it doesnt even have any provision to undo mirror effect in\ncamera setting.  \n  \nI bought this phone only for its camera and i am so sad that i am returning it\ndue to the above annoying feature.\n\n", "Although, I had ordered for a black one, what I rec'd. is a black and white\none. I wanted to return but my wife said let's keep it, as it was for her.  \n  \nWhile she is ok using it, I am totally disappointed.\n\n", "Google pixel 2 XL better than iPhone Apple 10\n\n", "Phone is awesome and no doubt its the best phone of 2017 but its too\ncostly.And moreover there is no service for Google products in India.2 years\nback I had bought Nexus 6.After warranty period,my phone got switched off.As\nit was manufactured by Motorola, I had been to its service centre in Banglore.\nThey said it will be around 40000/ for getting it repaired.

The\ncamera on this phone does wonders and it easily beats the long line of best\nsold camera smart phones such as the Lumia 1020, HTC M8, LG G5. The timely\nsecurity updates and patches are so good and it always makes the phone buttery\nsmooth. The battery life on this phone is best as Google does what it is\nsupposed to do by optimizing the apps and keeping the battery life steady.

Low light is good for still subjects but if\nit's moving you get a motion blur. HDR+ enhanced mode is where you get maximum\ndynamic range.

The screen issue is still there, but it\ndoesn't bother me at all. Battery backup is very good. Stereo speakers are\ngreat.  \n  \nPackage came with a 3.5mm adapter, USB (not micro usb)- usb c adapter and sim\nejecting tool.
