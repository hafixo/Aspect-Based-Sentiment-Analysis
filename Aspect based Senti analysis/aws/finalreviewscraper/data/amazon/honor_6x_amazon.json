To be freak I really didn't like\nthe depth effect as if we are editing it in a cheap blurring app. And rest of\nthe camera is cool with do many features. But recording in slowmotion\ndecreases the resolution which is quite disappointing.  \n  \nLOOKS- It is good but its not upto the mark when compared to xiaomi Redmi note\n5 which comes with the same price range.  \n  \nPERFORMANCE- While coming to performance its not bad and at the same time not\ngreat but okay maybe sometimes it lags when you pay high end and online games\nwhich exceeds 2gb. I really don't play games. But you can manage  \n  \nSTORAGE- It as a whooping 64 gigabyte in which you get along 49gb to access,\nwhich is great thumbs up for this!  \n  \nRAM-It as 4gb ram in which you get song 2.5gb free works well  \n  \nOVERALL- Great phone under 10k if you are looking for a budget phone with good\nspecifications. I would recommend this to everyone who loves clicking pictures\nand which as a huge storage.

Awesome battery life  \n3\\. Quick charging  \n4\\. 64 GB Memory is enough  \n5\\. Fingerprint Sensor is very accurate.  \n6\\. Multi tasking is very smooth.  \n7\\. Additional uses of fingerprint sensor like swipe left right to change\npicture when you have opened the gallery. Swipe up down to open notifications\nand swipe right to clear notifications.  \n8\\. Front camera takes pretty good selfies.  \n  \nCONS :  \n1\\. Hybrid slot  \n2\\. No USB C type cable  \n3\\. No front flash  \n  \nVerdict: If you are confused between redmi note 4 or honor 6x then you must go\nfor honor. If you think about price then it is only 1k more than note and on\nthe occasion of so many sales on Amazon you can get it for 13k which is\nsimilar to redmi note 4. Redmi note 4 only have more mah of battery but in all\nother departments honor 6x completely outclass RMN4. And when it comes to\nbattery also it has quick charge which takes less time when it comes to\ncharging. So without having a 2nd thought you can go for this phone if you are\nlooking for a solid smartphone with pretty good camera, battery, performance\nand after sale services.

Astounding battery\nconsumption optimization, thanks to the EMUI. Performance is good but the\nmetal body causes makes it hot fast... Maybe that will affect the chipset life\nin the long run. Though build quality is good, durability is down the drain -\nno Gorilla glass, no support of metal body to phone giving no structural\nsupport. Charging takes a while but is compensated by battery life. Cameras\nare beyond excellence. Overall its a good product with bad durability. If you\nwant to go for it, you have to spend a little more on tempered glass and\nprotective cover if you want it to stay all nice and fast even after a few\ndrops.\n\n", "Best Camera and rest all is better than most phones in the market although a\nlittle improvement in battery go for it without any hesitation!!Although i\nwould prefer Redmi Note 4 over Honor 6x it is tough competitor...\n\n", "Everything about this smartphone is good but you cannot use two Sims and\nmemory card simultaneously  \n  \nBut this problem is fixed when you have OTG cable and pendrive. As far as it\nis technology advance phone in this price range\n\n", "I love honor so so so much.. Honor is my love. I m a hardcore fan of Huawei\nand honor. I purchased honor holy and then I was amazed with its speciality.\nThen I unfortunately bought redmi Note4 in between but disappointed with its\nusage. Then opted this mobile which is honor 6x. It fulfilled all my\nexpectations and beyond my expectations too. It has great things which other\nmobiles dont have. It does things which latest mobiles fails to do. Even\nthough I have dropped it several times it didnt break. I dropped my phone from\na running bus, trust me Still worked awesome and no scratch too. It has so\nmany specifications really u will enjoy when u use it. Camera is good. It has\nmany options too. U can also have running video at the top to watch and use ur\nmobile simultaneously. It never hangs even if u use more than half space of\ninternal memory. Redmi mobiles and Samsungs hangs a lot. This phone doesnt\nheat up too. It has WiFi and wifi bridge too and another coolest option is\nwhen u shake ur mobile the wallpaper display will change automatically and it\nalso contains voice command calls too which means it detects ur voice and\ncalls that particular person. U can also change the color of the display And\nits size too. This mobile gives so many inbuilt applications to enjoy such as\nmirror, campus,health check and all UC apps. If u buy this mobile u will\nsurely enjoy. What I have said is very little. There is lot more to amuse us.\nThanks for those who read this.I have also attached few pictures which I room\nfrom this honor 6x mobile.\n\n", "I bought this phone for 15k. I still won't regret even though the prices have\nfallen diwn to 12k.

It has slipped\nmany times from heights as far above as my shoulder, yet, no shatters or\ndents. The screen as well as fingerprint sensor is very responsive. The best\nthing in the phone is its camera.

But this kind of dual\nsetup helps you to get a better low light pictures. That's why OnePlus also\nSwitched to this setup in op5 T . And the front cam is just the best you could\nget at this price point, no other phone perfoms so well with front cam.  \nYa if you just need a 2x zoom and better portrait choose the Mi a1 , and need\na better low light, selfi mode choose this one and the pro mode is best part\nand no other phone would provide such a pro mode. Ya I know Honor 7x has come\n, but it's not a big upgrade as screen resolution is lower and beside the\ninfinity display the phone has nothing new , even the design is not good for\nregular use as could damage the cam setup. Processor is a bit upgraded not\nthat much.  \nBut I think proper care and covers may help & choosing that one is also good\nif you just need a new gen display. But if you want better resolution opt for\nthis or honor 9i (which is bit costly).  \nPerformance___________________________________the performance is good and can\nplay many of the graphic intensive games without lags and can store much of\napps and games . So performance is not a issue, sometimes now I get some\nframedrops in some of the games very rarely I think it's bcz I have loaded\nmore than 100 apps and games.  \nDesign_________________________________________design is good but very prone\nto scratch and damages as it is metal surfaced , a slight hit could get some\nstraches or bends and the screen is too delicate can break if you drop it down\n. So get a tempered glass and cover so that it doesn't get damaged.  \nMany say that the audio quality of speakers is not good . But actually it's\ngood and gives loud sound in indoors. Outdoors every phone just fails to get a\naudible sound tested with Mi a1 and Xiaomi note 4 .  \nBattery life is good due to the battery backup and software, for a normal user\nit's two days and a heavy users may get a battery life of 1 day.  \n___so at last the it's up to you, choose according to your needs and\npreferences & not according to friends or 3rd person advice or tte best value\nfor money phone_______________________________  \nI also on YT , channel name is TecH 16 and also there a fb page , any doubts\nor difficulty to choose a phone just msg me your budget, requirements and\npreferences of features and i would suggest you the best.\n\n", "Ultimate phone in the price segment.

The battery lasts for a solid day\nfor heavy usage(playing a movie, playing atleast 800MB sized game, etc)  \n  \nSpotlight goes to the dual camera setup which is the first known in this\nsegment price range mobiles! I'm not at all disappointed with its outdoor\ncondition lighting and slips in artificial lights(it can be rectified in Pro\nPhoto mode if u could fit the adjustments) The only lack in camera is the\nvideo stabilization...could have been better than given.  \n  \nCons have to be absence of NFC and the second sim being only 2G support.

The fingerprint sensor is really good\nand quick. You will get Android 7 Nougat and EMUI 5 update once you boot up\nthe phone and check for updates.
