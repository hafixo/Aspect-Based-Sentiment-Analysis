Otherwise customer feel uncomfortable. Please send\nlaptop with uploaded softwao\n\n", "Good and value for money product.\n\n", "its very good looking laptop for basic use!\n\n", "An excellent budget laptop from HP at around 27k range. Being 15.6 inches, it\nhas separate numeric keypad and the keyboard has keys with good spacing in\nbetween. Overall performance is good for average daily usage of MS\noffice,youtube,netflix mails,light gaming etc. However not recommended for\nheavy gaming purposes due to core i3 CPU and 4 GB ram. Installed windows 10\nPro myself and saved about 4k.  \nIf required for heavy usage then opt for atleast core i5 CPU and 8 GB ram.\n\n", "Product is giid but body is very week. If HP can make body stronger then i\nwill give 5 star to it.\n\n", "Nice machine at this price range.  \nTouch and feel of this machine looks premium.  \n3 and a half to 4 hours of battery backup is what one can expect during usage.  \nNot good for games, Not much better than the Pentium CPUs.\n\n", "Pros  \nFast and quick performance with everyday use applications  \nGood quality vibrant display  \nFlawless keyboard and touchpad  \nLightweight and appealing design  \nLoud and crisp Audio  \n  \nCons  \nNo dedicated graphics card  \nNo Windows 10  \n  \nPerformance  \nIf your everyday PC use involves watching Youtube, movies, browsing the\nInternet, working with Microsoft office applications, etc Intel Core i3 6006U\nprocessor included in HP 15q-BU004TU is ample to carry out these tasks. The\nstock clock speed of 2GHz offered by 6006U can smoothly handle regular office\nand multimedia applications. Moreover, users can indulge in multitasking to a\ncertain extent. The 4 GB DDR4 (upgradeable up to 8GB) over single slot\nincluded in the laptop is adequate for running multiple casual applications.\nThe laptop does not come with a dedicated graphics card, it uses the\nintegrated Intel HD 520 graphics to function games and other graphics-oriented\napplications. With optimizing the settings- low details at 720p resolution,\nmany exciting games such as GTA 5, Call of Duty, Battlefield 4, etc can be\nplayed on this laptop. However, in all rights, this is not a gaming laptop.\nThe low weight games such as Fifa 17, Counter-Strike, Minecraft, Dota 2 etc\ncan be played at medium settings with good frame rates.  \n  \nDisplay  \nThe picture quality of the screen is satisfactory. For beginners, the screen\nmight appear exceptional but if examined closely or compared with other high-\nend displays, obviously it lacks in terms of contrast and sharpness. The best\nthing about this screen is its brightness. There is no dullness which gives\nclear visuals. The color reproduction ability is average. Overall, the 15.6\ninch HD (1366 x 768) LED-backlit display on this laptop is decent for a budget\nlaptop.  \n  \nKeyboard and Touchpad  \nThe keyboard on BU004TU is well laid out and exceptionally comfortable for\nlong hours of typing. The key travel is shallow and bit noisy. Overall, the\ncheapness is not suddenly obvious and it is a good keyboard in this price\nrange. The touchpad, unlike the conventional ones, does not have separate\nbuttons. It is quite precise and responsive. With the installation of the\nlatest synaptic driver from the HP site, the trackpad will function great\nwithout any problem.  \n  \nPorts and connectivity  \nThis laptop has a good variety of ports like many of the HP laptops in the\nrange. It is equipped with HDMI port, USB 2.0 port, RJ-45, headphone jack, and\n2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 (USB 3.0) ports. HP 15q-BU004TU is able to catch signals\nwithin 50m (164 feet) indoors and 100m (328 feet) outdoors. The Bluetooth 4.0\nunlike the older versions discovers devices quickly and is more secure in\nsending data.  \n  \nAudio  \nHP 15q bu004tu features dual 2W speakers. HP claims the speakers are suitable\nfor all types of usage- streaming videos, listening to music, watching movies\nand playing games. But this is sort of true. The speakers are definitely loud\nand clear but the these do not offer the best experience while playing games\nand listening to music. Using headphones in these cases is much more relevant\nthan hearing through these speakers because the sound emitted by them is\ncompressed and do not have clear bass. The overall audio is focused on mid and\ntreble parts. In a laptop at this price range, we can not expect anything\nbetter.  \n  \nBattery  \nThe laptop sports a 4-cell, 41 Wh Lithium-ion battery. It has the fast charge\nfeature which fills the battery quite fast- 2 hours for charging from zero to\nfull. When it comes to backup, on idle the laptop stays alive for more than 6\nhours. On heavy load, the backup diminishes up to 2.5 hours and on casual use\ninvolving browsing, watching movies etc it gives an average backup up to 4.5\nhours. The battery clearly outpaces Lenovo laptops in terms of backup in this\nprice range.  \n  \ni have attached pics as well Please check them out.  \nif my Review helped you in anyway. Please Vote it as HELPFUL\n\n", "Before buying Please check the warranty of product I have received used\nproduct with only 7 month warranty left,know I have to return the product\n\n", "Laptop is good. Lightweight. Slim. Battery is also good\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 19 November 2017", "on 24 February 2018", "on 24 January 2018", "on 4 November 2017", "on 17 March 2018", "on 8 October 2017", "on 13 March 2018", "on 6 February 2018", "on 26 February 2018", "on 5 February 2018"], "reviewer": ["Romtech", "Mukesh Mishra", "A.K.SINGH", "vishal b chougule", "amogh", "Anjesh Singh", "naveen", "Vinay Arora", "Amazon Customer", "Amazon Customer"]},
