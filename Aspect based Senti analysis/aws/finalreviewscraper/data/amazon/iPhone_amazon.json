Being an avid user of\nandroid, I still shifted to iOS. No matter how costly your android phone is,\nit will start lagging, over heating, sudden battery draining. As a result you\nhave face regular resetting of your android phone. iPhone is just a fresh wind\non all those irritating problems. Read carefully my review, which I have\nposted after 2months of use.  \nPros:  \n1) No lag, while atleast 60/70 apps running in background even.  \n2) Stunning photography could be done.  \n3) Highly sensitive auto brightness sensor. Changes the light very quick.  \n4) Google can be synced.  \n5) Contacts can be saved in Google directly. As a result, if you use an\nandroid phone & login through same Google account, your iPhone contacts will\nshow on android phone. Simultaneously if you save a contact at google, that\nwill reflect on your iPhone too. Just you need to keep Google auto sync mode\non in iPhone. Life is good.  \n6) 4K video is a pure charm once you watch it on your laptop.  \n7) Buy a gorrilapod @ \u20b9600, mount the phone on it, start slow motion video &\nleave it for an hour during sunrise or sunset. Just see the magic. A pure time\nlapse vide you would find. People call is SloMo with hashtag. Later transfer\nthe video to your pc & delete it from phone to free up the storage.  \n8) iPhone's 360degree photo, Square photo is iconic. Shoot a panorama pic &\npost it on facebook, it'll be converted into 360deegree.  \n9) So far no heating issue.  \n10) Very very fast charging. It gets 1% to 45% in less than 15mins.  \n  \nCons:  \n1) Average battery life. With power saver it can go upto 1.5 days. Without\nsaver I use it for entire the day.  \n2) In the era of 5.5 inch & 6 inch smartphones, this 4 inch screen is really\nlittle tough to get habituated. Nothing much, the very first issue you'd face\nis typing error or typo. If you are habitual using with 5 inch or bigger\nscreen, it will be little difficult to move your finger tips on proper\nalphabets. You want to write 'A', enough possibility is there that you would\npress on 'S' instead 'A'. But be assured, you'll be habituated within 2 weeks\ntime.  \n3) If you are bigger screen user, you might not like the video size in lower\nscreen size.  \nBut above two points are really ignorable. Human nature is based on their\nhabit. You'll be habituated with 4 inch screen, no worry.  \n4) Truecaller will work but not live. Apple won't any third party app to\ncompromise it's user's privacy, not even if the user himaelf wants to. After\nthe call, you need to copy the number & paste to Truecaller. It will work this\nway.  \n5) iPhone is not yours if you are multi sim user & do not want to keep more\nthan single phone.  \nClass says all. iPhone is meant for class users, who keeps single phone for\nmaking & receiving calls. Unlike those use who keep Jio for outgoing &\nVodafone for incoming.  \nJokes a part lol.  \n6) Storage is a real issue for this phone. These days 32gb is can not be\nenough for Vloggers like me. Again 64gb or 128gb version doesn't support my\npocket. Hence...  \n  \nConclusion:  \nIf you are confident, you could adjust with smaller screen size than your\nAndroid, if you could adjust little less battery backup, go for iPhone SE.\nBecause rest is all better than android. You'll get a pure lag free phone.\niPhone SE will never disappoint you by it's performance. Way better phone than\nany bigger screen, long battery backed up Android phones.  \n  \nPosting few pictures taken by my iPhone SE at Darjeeling.  \n  \nThus, I conclude & rest my unbiased opinion. Happy shopping.  \n  \nSumanta Chatterjee  \nKolkata\n\n", "Rattle sound when you tap on camera on 32GB Models.\n\n", "I phone SE(32 GB):  \nBattery backup amazing as compare to my old Redmi Note3. After moderate use of\nday I still get 25% battery in evening  \nPerformance is far better than any 3GB or 4GB android phone.Never lags in\nmultitasking  \nCamera: Quality of photos are some what good. Performance of 1.2 M Front\ncamera is great in day light . Never feel about lower pixel of front camera.  \nBuild quality is amazing . Compact and powerful device. Initially feel about\nsmall size but later on you will not feel about it.  \nWarranty and product is genuine and original .\n\n", "Totally in love with the phone. Although i use it as my secondary phone which\nmeans no social media and only work phone. i get an amazing 2 day battery back\nup. Good phone and to my surprise it did not get obsolete with the launch of\niphone 8 and iphone X.\n\n", "Best ever experience of mobile phone, this is my first iPhone which I could\nget under my budget with updated technology and features, I found it lightning\nfast, It runs without any lag even while operating multiple apps at a time.\nRear camera is unbeatable among the same range of mobiles available in market.\nPerson who is searching phone under the range of 15 to 20k budget should try\nit once if screen size doesn't matter much.\n\n", "This is my first iPhone as I\u2019ve been an android user till now and experience\nhas been great so far.  \nI was apprehensive of buying this phone online but after 3 days of usage i can\nsay the it was a correct decision. Order is completely geniune and came nicely\npacked. No issues so far. Updated to ios11 and it\u2019s great. A good buy for 19k.\nAnyone who loves small screen phone and wants to move to iPhone. This is it!\n\n", "Good phone;  \nno need at all to fit any accessories; I fitted tempered glass but I don't\nthink for a phone which costs Rs.26000/- can be protected with Rs.100/-\nTempered Glass!  \nAlso that \"feeling of Apple\" gets eliminated if you fit tempered glass!  \nSo I request not to fit it.....  \nEnjoy the original Apple device...That's better.\n\n", "Shifted back to 4\" after two year. The best phones I had used recently iPhone\n7 and google pixel. i found it most powerful mobile in 4\" . I think anyone who\nlove perfect size of mobile should go for SE 32 or 64 gb. And silver colour is\namazing as always\n\n", "I have receive an Indian assembled Iphone. Thank u amazon for that. Really\nproud of it. No words after all it a master design in software & hardware.\nWhen android offer 4-6 GB rams for smooth operations for the present time,\nIphone can provide better performance in 2 GB ram. There are more advantages\nthat can beat other android phones in same category.\n\n", "First of all, this phone is assembled in India and not in China. Do not get\nbothered about the hype of small size screen, which maybe the biggest concern\nfor whoever is purchasing this model, everything blends in nicely if you're\nnot expecting a 6s Plus size screen. This model comes with preloaded iOS 11.\nThan there is this premium hands on feel of the product. Camera is nice,\nHeadphone jack is still available in this model. So far I have not found out\nanything against the phone apart from a little 'faster than expected' battery\nconsumption.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 21 March 2018", "on 20 June 2017", "on 17 November 2017", "on 16 October 2017", "on 24 December 2017", "on 28 September 2017", "on 19 September 2017", "on 3 September 2017", "on 24 October 2017", "on 3 January 2018"], "reviewer": ["Sumanta Chatterjee", "Chandan V", "RD", "muditrajoriya", "Manish Pandey", "aman", "Amazon Customer", "SushilXYZ", "Sanjay Bhat S", "Dirghayu Parmar"]},
