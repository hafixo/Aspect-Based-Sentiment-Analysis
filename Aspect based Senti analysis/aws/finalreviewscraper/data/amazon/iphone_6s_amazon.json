Its value for money product\nand after all its a iPhone.  \nPlease Purchase 32GB version as its Cheaper or same that of 16GB version\n(Didn't understand why this abnormal pricing).  \nIf you want you 1st iPHONE, then PLEASE, DO NOT Purchase iphone 7 over this,\nbecause its much expensive, has almost Similar Features and user Experience\nand Most Importantly iPhone 8 is Coming this Year, so it would be Foolish to\ngo for iPhone 7 over 6s.  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nThank You for reading this review.\n\n", "I will be describing my experience as of the current time (late 2017) and\nprice around 32-35K (as it keeps fluctuating).  \nI got this phone during the diwali sale .. for my mother who was earlier on an\nandroid. Iphones are the best bet if you are starting new in the smartphone\nworld. Well I know smartphones have been here for quite a while but there are\nalways starters .. (like my Mom).  \nThe ios interface is niche and simple as compared to its android counterpart.\nIf your needs are just basic ( like clicking pics, calling, using a few other\nmessaging apps etc)..and you want a premium phone with an attractive design\nwhich is fast, durable and feels good to hold in hand, this is the one to go.  \nYou can get cheaper android phones with similar or even better configurations\n(one plus 5, Nokia series etc) but IOS experience is the deal maker here. You\nIphone is definitely going to have a better life than any of the android\ncounterparts. Plus the long term apple software support for its devices makes\nthem a great deal. (iphone 5s is still supported by Apple even after 4 years..\nwhich no other manufacturer does)  \n  \nI also bought a one plus 5 for my dad and I can tell you, the phone is\ndefinitely faster than the 6s but still I prefer the overall experience of\niphone.  \n  \nIf you are a geeky person or anyway you want high customizability for your\nphone interface.. camera (one plus 5 offers DSLR capabilities) Android is\ndefinitely the way, but if you are a simple user who just wants to get the\nwork done with a nice and simple interface then the iphone is for you.  \nPlease prefer 6s over iphone 6 due to the 1gb ram difference.. Upcoming\nsoftware updates might just be much heavy. Also it only has slight differences\nfrom the upper models like 7 and 8 so its a good long term bet.  \nI personally bought an iphone 7 due to the water resistance and better\nbattery, but i did not find any performance difference in daily use.  \nHope it helps..!!\n\n", "Why should you care about the iPhone 6S?  \nIts a phone that is similar when compared with its sibling the iPhone 6 but\nhey its not the same device its an another iPhone but in the same clothing  \n  \nwhat is all about the iPhone 6S..?  \nits a phone that has the same chassis as the famous iPhone 6, but hey the\nphone is not at all the same this is known as 6S comes with some unique colour\nlike Rose gold, just not the color this iPhone has a feature like 3D touch\nwhich is again a patent unique to apple iPhone only you wont get to see this\nfeatures in any other smartphone, other than that it comes with the best\ncamera 12MP i-sight camera which is one of the best in its category even after\nthis device is two year old but everyone wants to buy it there are no changes\nbut still everyone wants to own one this is the magic of Apple.  \n  \nIt also gets an bigger battery which makes this device last longer and due to\nthe A9 processor the battery has surely improved making this device faster\nthan Before this surely makes this device a perfect buy in 2017 if you want to\nhave smart looking iPhone device this should be your choice it also looks\npretty neat then the latest iPhone 7 and there are no much big differences\nbetween both the device this phone will outperform all those big size android\nsmartphones, this can surely be your cup of cake, if you are tired using those\nandroid device and want to come to iPhone family, and have a budget that of\niPhone 6s guys then this is the right choice for you, you are getting a\nbalance specification which comes with iPhone 7 and, this part is lovely.  \n  \nToday owing This iPhone is just like driving a BMW where quality matters the\nmost, One advice i would like to give to all those who are reading this if you\nhave finalized getting this iPhone make sure you wait for this June end as\nthere can be a price drop in coming months which can save you some amount\nafter the launch of iPhone 8.  \n  \nEven getting this phone at this price will surely make your day once you start\nusing it,  \n[...]\n\n", "Received a t-shirt instead of the iPhone.\n\n", "I wish i could give anything less than 1 star.  \nGot a box of marble pieces instead.  \nWe had only heard or seen this happening with other people but this time it\nhas happened to me...and ita for real trust you me guys...\n\n", "Fully damaged product was delivered by Cloudtail. The device was already\nswitched on by the time we opened the package. I had ordered this as a gift\nfor someone and now i'm thoroughly embarrassed. Trying to get a replacement.\nLet's see how it goes.\n\n", "Yes, it's a wise decision to buy an iPhone 6S in 2018 if you get some\ndiscount. I bought it at 30k. I am loving it. Super stylish, classy look.\nPerformance is very fluid. Love the 3D touch, iHealth, iMessage and many more\nfeatures that missing in android. I found iOS is more reliable, more secure\nthan android. Battery back up is very good. Easily last more than a day with\nhigh usage. I don't compare iPhone with android devices. If you know what is\nan iPhone then you never go for android for your primary phone. I too have a\nandroid. I'm using Samsung C9 pro, but using it as secondary device.\n\n", "delivered used product\n\n", "I have upgraded from 5s to 6s the 5s was also bought from amazon 3 years ago\nwhich was genuine with good packing. This 6s is also 100 percent genuine and\nalso the delivery was fast, i got it within 2 days. As usual apple is\nButtersmooth and the interface is awesome i currently feel that i had really\nupdated because the overall feel while using 6s with respect to 5s is awesome.  \nNow i have to say something to people who says that they are getting false\nproducts, i suggest them to check the seller initially, do not blindly click\nthe link with less price please do carefully check the seller and also the\nseller reviews the seller cloudtail is the most trusted since it is amazon\nseller which is 100 % trustable.  \nAnother thing is if you have purchased a mobile you can check its genuinity\neasily, if it's an apple i phone its easy to check that the package contains\ngenuine i phone. please type \"apple IMEI check\" in google enter the IMEI\nnumber provided in the invoice of your order it will shows the model and the\nentire warranty information and also the condition of the phone that is it\nused or not. Please do consider this little things then your online shopping\nwill be satisfied with peace of mind.  \nI have been shopping with amazon since 2013 i didn't even occur any problems\nand also the products which i have bought is with outstanding quality and also\ngenuine with long lasting.\n\n", "\u25cf There are the different iPhones currently sold in India as on Jul-17  \n\\- iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus  \n\u25cf There is no point in writing in length about these phones since everyone is\nvery well aware on the reasons why they may shop for an iphone. So, I thought\nit make sense to compare the prominet features that could help you to make\nyour decision easier  \n  \n** iPhone SE **  \n\u25cf This is a 4 inch phone that fits very comfortably into your hands and is\ngood for your wallet since the 16GB version costs around Rs.21,000  \n\u25cf This packs the same A9 processor, camera, fingerprint sensor and many other\nfeatures of iPhone 6S and 6s Plus  \n\u25cf The 12mpx camera is one of the best among phones around Rs.20,000. It\nsupports 4K videos, live photos, full HD slow motion video, etc.  \n\u25cf In terms of performance also, the phone stands among the top in the list in\nthe Rs.25,000 bracket  \n\u25cf If you dont like big screen phones, this is the best phone for you. But I\nwould say if you have used a bigger screen phone, you would definitely\nstruggle with a smaller screen since reading stuff on a 4 inch screen may not\nbe a better experience for you. In that case, spend this money on an Android\nphone and you will love it  \n  \n** iPhone 6s **  \n\u25cf The main difference 6s has over SE is that 6s has got 3D Touch and display\nzoom other than a bigger screen of 4.7 inches  \n3D touch is an amazing feature where the phone can understand the pressure you\nput on screen while touching and can activate various functions like double\nclick, left click or many other functions that could have been achieved by\nmore than one click  \n\u25cf 6s also comes with a 128GB option while SE stops at 64GB  \n\u25cf 6s has got a larger battery, but there is not much difference in battery\nendurance due to the bigger display  \n\u25cf The selfie camera is also upgraded from 1.2mpx in SE to 5mpx in 6s  \n\u25cf So, if you are on a tight budget, but still want to go for an iPhone, this\none is the best choice. I bought the 32GB version for Rs.35,888 in Jun-17  \n  \n**iPhone 6s Plus **  \n\u25cf The only difference 6s Plus has over 6s is the screen size which is 5.5 inch\nand optical image stabilisation for main camera  \n\u25cf 6s Plus had been infamous for rumours that the phone could bend from the\npressures of your pocket, but Apple is reported to have addressed it by using\nhigh-grade aluminium  \n\u25cf Optical Image Stabilisation works can effectively eliminate effects of\ncamera shake and images are sharper. This is especially useful during low\nlight where the exposre is longer and there are more changes for your hand to\nshake or shiver during shooting  \n\u25cf The larger screen is good for watching videos, reading, etc. And if you are\na gamer, spending this much for a 5.5 inch phone makes sense. This is sold at\naround Rs.45,000 for the 16GB version  \n\u25cf The phone performance and battery endurance is very much similar to iphone\n6s  \n\u25cf If you dont have a need for a larger screen, I would not recommend to spend\nmore money, but iPhone 6s would do good for you. if you are serious on this\none, I would suggest to spend a little more and go for iPhone 7  \n  \n** iPhone 7 **  \n\u25cf iPhone 7 brings in a low of new features  \n\u25cf This comes with a 4.7inch display. The display is one of the best on\nsmartphones with a lot of new features. In practical, the display is brighter,\nvery easy on eyes and colour reproduction is more accurate  \n\u25cf The processor is upgraded to A10 and the camera sensor is also upgraded that\nexcels is low light photography. The dual camera system captures depth\ninformation  \n\u25cf There is no 3.5mm headphone plug, instead it packs the wireless earpods.\nHowever, it comes with a 3.5mm adapter that connects to the lightning port  \n\u25cf The phone is splash as well as dust resistant  \n\u25cf The jet black and red are the new colours iPhone 7 is sold in  \niPhone 7 is one of the biggest update and comes with a lot of exciting\nfeatures. The 32GB version is sold at Rs.49,000. If you are serious about\niPhone 7, you may need to think spending around Rs.60,000 for the black or red\nsince the phone does not look much different from iPhone 6s if not on these\ncolours  \n  \n** iPhone 7 Plus **  \n\u25cf This is only for those people who have got deep pockets. The base version is\nsold at around Rs.72,000  \n\u25cf The phone has got a bigger screen of 5.5 inch and a superior camera with\noptical zoom & telephoto aperture  \n  \n** Summary **  \n\u25cf Go for iPhone SE only if you use your phone mainly to make calls or if you\nare upgrading from a smaller phone. If you are moving from a bigger screen\nphone, the 4 inch display of this phone will not be a welcoming experience  \n\u25cf iPhone 6s is the phone that I recommend if you have a tight budget, but\nwould like to boast of your iPhone among your mates  \n\u25cf 6s Plus is not at all recommended because you will get iPhone 7 with a lot\nof new features if you spend a little more. However, if your only need is a\nlarger screen I wont discourage you  \n\u25cf iPhone 7 is in a different league. Its the best iPhone available today\naccording to me  \n\u25cf If you are struggling to find ways to spend your hard-earned money, put it\non iPhone 7 Plus black or red where you will get an amazing gadget to show\noff.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 9 April 2017", "on 24 October 2017", "on 27 May 2017", "on 4 May 2017", "on 4 October 2017", "on 13 July 2017", "on 8 February 2018", "on 7 May 2017", "on 18 August 2017", "on 23 July 2017"], "reviewer": ["Sameer Patil", "Anubhav Rai", "Karan Singh", "Amazon Customer", "manan", "Pavan Kulkarni", "Koushik", "Amazon Customer", "Edukrishnan.v", "Friendly Sparrow"]},

My serious advice to you first of all is that be very sure you want an\niPhone before making a switch because android users will find that iOS is\npretty restricting and not as customizable and feature packed as android. I\nhave been using it for two days and already feeling the frustration of a lot\nof missing features. A lot of basic tasks require one or two extra steps in\niPhone that can be done with a single click in android.  \nThat being said iphones have superior build, better resale value and higher\nsecurity so over all they are good if you are willing to spend so much for a\nphone. The camera is definitely way better than anything I got on any of the\nhigh end android phones I used. Compared to App Store reviews in google play,\nthe apple App Store seems pretty deserted as far as reviews and activities on\nIndian apps is concerned.  \nOver all I have mixed feelings about making the switch to apple. It will take\nmore time getting used to. If you are a typical google fanboy or girl and use\na lot of android features then I suggest you don't go for iPhone, android has\nway better variety in market.  \nAs for the phone itself, nothing much to say except you get what you pay for.\nIt is a beautiful and sleek phone with excellent performance. No heating or\nhanging issues whatsoever. Charging is blazing fast as well compared to my\nandroid phones. It was a big investment and I hope I will be delighted by the\niPhone experience in due time.\n\n", "I received the phone on 27th and wanted to return on 4th April. The speakers\nof the phone dont work properly and I intended to to return it back. Neither\nspeaker-mode nor handset mode nor headphone modes are working.

But I have been told to contact\napple not amazon to do so even though I am eligible for return till 6th April.\nThey say its their policy with apple. Why didnot they tell me this while\nbuying the phone? I am stuck now so awfully. People have been warning me not\nto buy from amazon but I did not heed to their warnings and believed amazon.

The processing speed is very\ngood preferable for non gamer.  \nIt's new feature Siri is not good, I would say it's one of the drawbacks of\nthis phone. It only functions with internet support and in India there is lot\nof network problem. Even if there is internet support it does not work\nproperly.  \nIt's battery life is also one of the drawbacks. The battery lasts for 9 hrs\nonly ( not on heavy use). Since it does not have Bluetooth support, if we use\nShareIt then apps shared over it does not work on this phone.  \nIt also does not display music files in music library which are received from\non whatsapp, mail or even downloaded from google, you are only able to\ndownload music from app music or through ShareIt.  \nOverall I would recommend you to buy Oneplus 5 or Honor 8.

They're high end premium devices that come out once a year\n(commonly) which pack pretty much every high tech feature imaginable.  \n  \nThey represent a company's idea of what a powerful phone should be. But like a\nlever other phone, even they get 'old'.  \n  \nAnd I'm guessing we all use our premium phones for at least 2 years. In that\ncase, how a phone ages overtime also plays a crucial role in determining it's\npower and value.  \n  \nSo taking a second look at them after several years of release is a worthwhile\nthing to do.  \n  \nLet's do just that. How about we take a second look at Apple's ex- flagship\nmodel, the iPhone 6s. How has it aged since September 2015? Is it still worth\nbuying in 2017? Let's find out.  \n  \nSo, the iPhone 6s has seen some price drops recently. The base model has been\nbumped up to 32 GB, which if not impressive, is still better than the\nworthless 16 gig model we had earlier.  \n  \nYou all know how that phone was perceived by the public back in 2015. After\nall the excitement died down, these are the things that have (kinda) held up\nafter approximately 2 years of usage:  \n  \nThe build: The phone is made our of 7000 series aluminium and has managed to\nsurvive a few minor drops over the period of its moderate usage.  \n  \nIt will last a pretty long time, if you are somewhat careful with your\nhandling.  \n  \nThe display: Yes, I know. It's not even 1080p. But the lack of pixels isn't as\nevident unless you compare it side by side with a full HD panel.  \n  \nOn its own, it's still pretty good, though you can't play 1080p videos on your\n'premium' phone. But it has that excellent brightness output of (close to) 600\nnits, so there's that!  \n  \nThe front camera(somewhat..): The front camera remains pretty good, even among\nthe present gen smartphones which are all set out to be 'selfie experts'!\nYou'll have good quality selfies and videos upto 720p from this front snapper.  \n  \nAlthough you get higher quality videos from other phones, you can't deny the\naccurate colors that this phone captures.  \n  \nThe software: Well, I'm talking about the software support. It still has the\nlatest and greatest OS updates from Apple and won't be discontinued any time\nsoon. That's not to say it's flawless though. I've experienced several lags\nand slow downs and crashes throughout the UI, from iOS 9 till 10.3 to date.\nMore on that later.  \n  \nThese were some of the things that still remain significant despite to the\ncut-throat competition.  \n  \nNow let's look at the things that aren't doing too well after aging:  \n  \nThe general performance: Now let me be clear, the 6s is not a laggy mess by\nany means. To a lot of people, it's still a pretty fast and fluid phone. But\nit does slow down quite a lot.  \n  \nI've seen a lot of phones and I can clearly see some dropped frames in the UI/\nanimations and delays while opening apps such as camera or facebook.  \n  \nIn other words, even the iPhone is affected by age and can slow down to a\ncrawl overtime.  \n  \nThe 64 gb model I've seen has managed to stay decently responsive, but hasn't\naged as smooth as something like the Nexus 6P. That phone is still one of the\nsmoothest out there!  \n  \nBattery life: You probably saw this one coming. The small 1810 mAh on the 6s\nbarely lasts a day of usage, and has gotten worse overtime.  \n  \nHaving too many apps on board along with mixed 4G/ wifi usage drains this tiny\ncell pretty quickly. You won't make it through a day, if you're constantly\nusing wireless services.  \n  \nRecharge speed also sucks. The puny charger included can barely pump put 1 amp\nof current and takes about an hour and a half to completely charge this thing.\nIt's unacceptable at least in my view, because it's dumb.  \n  \nSuch a small battery unit shouldn't take so damn long to charge up.  \n  \nThe Hardware: Yeah, things aren't too bright over here either. I'm taking\nabout the sensors and stuff.  \n  \nAfter 2 years of usage, the fingerprint sensor known as TouchID has stopped\nreliably working. It fails to recognise my fingerprint 6/10 times.  \n  \n\u200bThat's sad, considering it was one of the finest when it was launched. It was\npositively criticized of being 'way too fast' at the time. Now its 'way too\nfrustrating'.  \n  \nThe finger as well as the home button needs to be cleaned nicely before I can\nplace my thumb on it. But when it does work, it's still pretty fast at\nunlocking.  \n  \nOther things like the genealogy specs aren't too great for 2017 either. Though\n2 GB of RAM is good enough for iOS, it's not the king of multitasking any\nmore.  \n  \nThe DDR3 unit can barely keep some heavy duty apps and games open in the\nbackground. You'll see a lot more app and launcher reloads with modern day\napps, and this will only get slower overtime.  \n  \nThe rear camera: Though the front sensor remains pretty competent, the rear\ncamera sadly isn't.  \n  \nThe 12 mp sensor with a tiny aperture is easily bested by even mid range\nphones of the present day. It's good enough outdoors bit produces pretty\ngrainy and blurry images indoors and at night. Not super happy about that.  \n  \nOkay, this was the breakdown about what's good and what's not good about the\niPhone 6s, today. So should you buy this price dropped phone now?  \n  \nIf you're a strictly casual user who sticks to basic apps, doesn't mind about\nthe rather poor battery life but wants above average performance, I'd say go\nfor it. You'll probably be okay with the 32 gb storage too.  \n  \nBut if you are anywhere near a 'moderate/heavy user zone', you know what to do\nalready. Look elsewhere! There are much, much better phones that this one for\nhardcore road warriors among you, which will not only serve you well overtime,\nbut will also pack modern hardware.\n\n", "Amazing it\u2019s true Iphone is Iphone no comparison It\u2019s touch is so amazing .\nBattery backup was very good. IPhone 6s was best decision as compare to Iphone\n7, it\u2019s 2gb ram is make ur iPhone very reliable\n\n", "It's hard to write reviews about iconic, and commercially successful products,\nlike the iPhone, because it is unlikely that we will be able to find something\nto write - that has not already been written about.  \n  \nNonetheless, the perspective of a rating changes, when the price-point of a\nproduct changes. The fact that the 6S is today available at a price at which\nthe 5S used to be sold 2 years ago, does make one look at this phone\ndifferently.  \n  \nFor those (like me) who are loyalists of timeless & classic design\nmasterpieces from Nokia (N-Series, Lumia 9XX), Apple (5-series), and HTC (One-\nseries) the iPhone 6/7-series design changes were a sacrilege, that tantamount\nto succumbing in to mass-market needs. However, look beyond that, and the\niPhone 6S is still as beautifully crafted as all iPhones are, and it is hard\nto find any flaws per se.  \n  \nAnd for those of us, who care more about what's under the hood, rather than\nthe shell, the relative price difference between the 6 and the 6S is worth it.  \n  \nPersonally, I like the marginally thicker design of the 6S, as it gives the\nphone some much-needed heft, as well as the necessary psychological\nreassurance of eliminating any fears of Bendgate, that battered the iPhone 6's\nimage. Build quality and craftsmanship continue to be top notch.  \n  \nThe improvement in responsiveness & performance is evident, especially if you\nare upgrading from a 2-year old 5S, as is the improvement in the quality of\nthe Retina display. I also think that the form factor of 4.7\" screen strikes\nthe right balance between readability & usability; and is therefore another\nstep in the right direction.  \n  \nThe higher resolution front-facing camera is a much-needed fix for today's\nselfie-obsessed generation, and irons out one of the key weaknesses of the old\nphone.  \n  \nNeedless to say, the increase in RAM to 2GB, is also reassuring, as it\nincreases the perceived life of the phone, given that apps will continue to\nbecome more & more memory intensive. Not that 1GB RAM was ever inadequate for\nthe 5-series, because the beauty of iOS (like Windows Phone) lay in the fact\nthat it is, by design, a far more resource-efficient Operating System, when\ncompared to Android.  \n  \nOn the whole, a worthy buy for those who don't care much about flaunting the\nlatest & biggest, especially at the price-points it is now available at.  \n  \nAnd yes, most women, like my wife, will tend to like the Rose Gold variant :-)\n\n", "Writing this review from my iPhone 6s . Got this phone at 28k during great\nIndian sale .  \nvery much satisfied with this beauty .\n\n", "There is a denial of service from Apple and Amazon even warranty is void for a\nINR 40000=00 product after purchasing in a 15 days time.\n\n", "No words to express..always awesome\n\n", "Warenty card is not found so how is it? There is just a bill and there is no\ndiscription of warenty in it.\n\n", "Writing a brief review about my iPhone 6s gold 32gb bought during festive sale  \n  \nFirst of all thanx to amazon and green mobile(seller) for providing me a\ngenuine product and well in time, great job both of you.  \nI was hesitating first because of some negative reviews but hopefully I got a\ngenuine one.  \n  \nNow something about the phone.  \nGreat design looks premium and what I like most is display size neither small\nnor big, easy to carry in pocket  \n  \nPerformance is incredible so far and what is for sure about apple products is\nthat it will remain smooth in future too, every app and game runs without\nhanging issue. I am pretty much satisfied with performance iPhone 2gb ram is\nbetter than any other 4-6 gb ram  \n  \nCamera is super worth the price and with Live Photos ,4K recording and much\nmore I am sure rear camera is best in this range  \nFront cam is also great and with Retina Flash it works well for selfie lovers\ntoo better than 12-15 mp of other companies  \n3D Touch is helpful but we need to get used to it ( first time iPhone users )  \nEverything is great in this product if you are an iPhone lover or boared using\nandroid and your budget is near about 30k  \nLast thing to mention here is battery performance it lags a bit for battery\nperformance but becasuse of it we can't call it a bad product for average\nusers it can last a day but with heavy usage it gives approx 7 hours  \nNow choice is yours guys do like my review if you find it helpful\n\n", "iPhone 6S, launched back in 2015 is still a beast today. It's one of the most\nfastest, snappiest and the premium mobile phones available today. It's miles\nahead of the iPhone 6 in terms of technology, hardware and performance, and on\npar with even the iPhone 7 (it doesn't have the matte black and jet black\nvariants though).  \n*Pros*:  \n1\\. You'll enjoy the best user experience with the iOS. Only the Google Pixel\ncan match it in terms of UI design and software performance.  \n2\\. The camera is phenomenal. It takes the most natural photos and has super\nquick autofocus. The front camera takes good selfies in low-light as well. You\ncan shoot 4K videos, although without optical image stabilisation, it's a bit\ndifficult.  \n3\\. The 2nd Generation Touch ID fingerprint scanner is the fastest in any\nphone. All you have to do is rest your finger on the home button and it\nunlocks.  \n4\\. It's great for multitasking. With the 2 GB RAM and the A9 chip, you can\nhave at least 15 different apps open and the phone won't lag or stutter for a\nsecond.  \n5\\. It's great for playing games, whether you're playing casual games or\nplaying heavy console-level stuff.  \n  \n*Cons:*  \n1\\. The battery is just okay. On most days, you'll get 15-18 hours on medium\nusage. Although on heavy usage days, you may need to plug it in once in the\nevening.  \n2\\. The design seems a bit outdated now. With phones like Galaxy S8 coming\nout, Apple needs to refresh their design.  \n3\\. Photography is not great in low light. It's still better than most phones\navailable in the market, but you won't be satisfied.  \n  \nAnd that's it! You'll feel complete with this phone. iPhone 6S compliments you\nin every imaginable way. So, don't think twice before buying!\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 22 October 2017", "on 6 August 2017", "on 30 October 2017", "on 26 May 2017", "on 23 September 2017", "on 19 June 2017", "on 30 August 2017", "on 15 May 2017", "on 12 October 2017", "on 27 April 2017"], "reviewer": ["Amazon Customer", "Hemanth Shenoy", "Shekhar", "JPJ", "Shailesh Kumar", "chiranjeevulu sistu", "Dinnu", "Amazon Customer", "Sombir", "Adwitiya Pal"]}
