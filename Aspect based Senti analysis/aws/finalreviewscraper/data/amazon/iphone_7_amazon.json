The\nnew iOS works swift and fast and is very suitable for the the 7. Amazon\noffered a great deal on the phone during Diwali and I got it for about 37,500.\nAmazon delivery was straight up; the phone was seal packed and retains the\napple 1 year warranty. The matte black is a great colour, relatively harder to\nscratch than the jet black version too. This one has a very subtle look to it;\nun-exagerated and un-boastful in appearance.  \n  \nFor new iPhone users, this is a competitive price to start off with the iPhone\nexperience. Apple makes very simplistic designs and has a clear philosophy.\nThe phone does not allow for much customisability options but in itself is\ncontent.  \n  \nGreat deal made the Diwali a happy one.  \n  \nProduct Quality: 10/10  \nPrice Value: 10/10  \n  \n-soothsayer\n\n", "Phone is brand new, but came with a scratch on the top.

Phone design, look is great. Someone said Apple 2 GB RAM =\nAndroid 4 GB RAM. It\u2019s true.Apple camera clarity is really good. apps loading\ntime is very quick and so fast. Battery back up is satisfactory. I\u2019m\ncontinually using mobile with Mobil data on, phone could long last for 1 1/2\nday. Fingerprints sensor is very fast & accurate .

I will request Amazon to look into this matter and inform me.\n\n", "Well to top it off the phone is quite good and is a delight to use...but dont\ngo for the model in jet black...the glossy finish looks good but eventually\nyou will get white spots on its back if you use a cover and the sppts just\nspoils the jet black experience for you...the issue of ehite spots can be\ncross checked on apple site as various consumers have complained about\nit...guess the review helps\n\n", "I had been using this phone for the past 7 months so can give you my\nperspective.  \nI Had been using Android flagship( that too a nexus) for over past few years.\nAnd that nexus was unusable after 2 years.  \nAnd on top of that Google stopped android updates after 2 yrs of phone's\nrelease which was main driving force for me to switch over to Apple.  \nAnd that decision could never have been better.  \nSo coming to phone itself,it's amazing. Let's list them as pros and cons:  \nPros:  \n1.UI is buttery smooth  \n2\\. Camera is great with snappier response.  \n3\\. Processor is way ahead of the Android counter parts.  \n4\\. Many Ios apps are better optimized than. android versions.  \n5\\. Dust and water resistant. (IP67)  \n6\\. Thin,light and amazing for one handed use.  \n7\\. Great battery life can last you a day easily with moderate to heavy use.  \n8\\. Future ios updates are guaranteed unlike in case of Android.  \n9\\. Best IPS panel in the market with spectacular viewing angles.  \n10\\. Call quality is best in class.  \n  \nCons:  \n1\\. Low resolution screen (720p)  \n2\\. Kind of limited flexibility as compared to android (which is a trade of\nyou have to make if u buy ios devices)\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 4 August 2017", "on 12 October 2017", "on 28 October 2017", "on 2 January 2018", "on 29 January 2018", "on 10 February 2018", "on 2 October 2017", "on 11 November 2017", "on 22 February 2018", "on 4 March 2018"], "reviewer": ["Vijay Shinde-Amazon Customer", "N SATISH KUMAR", "soothsayer", "DareDevilNomad", "mohamed fazil", "Saurabh Srivastava", "vijay", "9830086052", "puneet", "Saurabh"]},
