My advise, never buy a phone online, always buy such phones from\nauthorised stores.\n\n", "Great\n\n", "Got my phone delivered last week, and I am impressed. Below are my thoughts\nabout this product. Views are strictly personal and mean no harm to users of\nother phones.  \n  \nA lot of people are in a dilemma whether this phone is any improvement over\niPhone 7? My verdict: Absolutely YES. First its a newer generation phone with\na more powerful chipset underneath. The difference in price between iPhone 7,\n32GB and iPhone 8, 64 GB model is hardly 11k. So you get:  \n\\- a faster processor(by upto 70%),  \n\\- Better CAMERA(Best camera at launch, improved lowlight images, much better\nimage processing),  \n\\- WIRELESS CHARGING  \n\\- 2x memory.  \n\\- Louder and better quality speaker  \n\\- True tone brightness (helps to protect your eyes, is different from night\nmode)  \n\\- Moreover since its a newer model, apple will provide the support for this\ndevice for 1 year more than iPhone 7.  \n  \nAll this for just 11k more. And since its upto 70% faster than iPhone 7, it\nwill show much better performance in later years as compared to iPhone 7. If\nyou plan to keep your phone beyond 2 years then 8 should be your pick. It can\neasily serve you well for 4 years, and will be on the latest software for at-\nleast 5 years(which is 2022, going by apple's support cycle for current\nphones, example: iphone 5s was launched in 2013 and still gets the latest iOS\n11).  \n  \niPhone 8 vs iPhone X?  \niPhone X is a rockstar, Show stopper. It has got a better camera and all but\nits still costs a whopping 33k more!! All you missout in iPhone 8 compared to\niPhone X is:  \n\\- Dual lens camera (8 plus has it)  \n\\- Face detection (much talked about, though some people prefer the touch id)  \n\\- Bezel less display (Showoff stuff IMO)  \n\\- THATS ALL!!  \n  \nPlus points  \n\\- iPhone 8 has the exact same chipset under its skin.  \n\\- Has wireless charging same as iPhone X!  \n\\- Retains the old tried, tested and loved touch id.  \n\\- Has the same no-nonsense and durable iPhone design that people have trusted\nfor years!!  \n  \nI think that I have emphasized enough on why iPhone 8 is the phone to buy and\nwould not let you down.\n\n", "iPhone 8 Review  \n  \n\u2714\ufe0f DESIGN:  \n\u2022 The iPhone 8's aluminium rear has been replaced with a glass finish - which\nfeels impressively grippy in hand - its overall finish is the same as that\nwhich debuted three years ago. This means it does feel somewhat dated,\nespecially when placed down next to\u00a0Samsung's Galaxy S8, although those fond\nof Apple's go-to design unlikely will have any complaints.  \n\u2022 \u200eThis dated feel is largely down to the\u00a0chunky bezels that surround\u00a0the\n4.7in screen, with Apple's rivals - and even Apple itself - making the move\ntowards full-screen, bezel-free devices. This does mean that there's room for\nApple's trusty Touch ID sensor underneath the display, though, which has so\nfar worked flawlessly every time.  \n\u2022 \u200eLike the\u00a0iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is waterproof too, thanks to the handset's\nIP67 certification which means, in theory, it should withstand being dunked\ninto water up to 1 metre for 30 minutes. This has rung true for us so far, but\nwe\u00a0try and avoid getting the handset too wet given its exposed ports on the\nbottom.  \n\u2022 \u200eThe iPhone 8 is a tad heavier than last year's iPhone 7 at 148g, which we\nfound made it feel more robust. It apparently is, according to Apple, which\nboasts that the glass on the phone's rear is the \"most durable glass ever on\nan iPhone.\" We haven't managed to drop our iPhone 8 yet, but it feels like it\ncould withstand a tumble or two.  \n\u2022 \u200eElsewhere on the handset you'll find the Lightning port on the bottom edge\nis flanked by a speaker and microphone, and there's nothing up top. There's no\nreturn for the 3.5mm audio jack, but Apple includes a Lightning to 3.5mm\nheadphone jack adapter in the box.  \n\u2022 \u200eThere's also updated stereo speakers, which make the phone around 25\npercent louder than the iPhone 7.  \n  \n\u2714\ufe0f DISPLAY:  \n\u2022 The iPhone 8's display is largely identical to the iPhone 7. And the 6S,\nand, er, the iPhone 6. This means that the 4.7in screen, with its 1,334x750\nresolution, does feel somewhat\u00a0old-fashioned, not to mention small, compared\nto the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2, again, added to by the bezels that\nsurround it. Quality wise, while it pales against its rivals on paper, we've\nno complaints, and it continues to be among the sharpest and most vibrant on\nthe market.  \n\u2022 \u200eThe only real change to the iPhone 8's screen is the addition of Apple's\nTrue-Tone technology that first debuted on the 9.7in iPad Pro.\u00a0This True Tone\nalters the colour temperature of the display depending on the environment in\nwhich you're in, reducing the harsh blue tones typical of an LCD when you're\nin a\u00a0dimly lit room.  \n  \n\u2714\ufe0f PERFORMANCE:  \n\u2022 Apple's new A11 Bionic chip sits under the hood of the iPhone 8 and, as\nexpected, it's incredibly fast.  \n\u2022 \u200eSpecs-wise, the six-core CPU comprises of two low-performance cores and\nfour high-performance cores, with the regular cores being 25 per cent faster\nthan the previous A10 chip, and the high-performance cores being up to 75 per\ncent faster than the A10 SoC, according to Apple It also comes paired with\nApple's first homegrown GPU, which offers 30 per cent more performance than\nthe A10.  \n  \n\u2714\ufe0f SOFTWARE:  \n\u2022 The iPhone 8 ships with iOS 11, naturally, which brings\u00a0with it improvements\nto Siri, reworked lock screen notifications, a new-look Control Centre and\nApple's redesigned App Store.  \n  \n\u2714\ufe0f CAMERA:  \n\u2022 On paper,\u00a0the main camera on the iPhone 8 is no different to that found on\nthe iPhone 7, with Apple retaining the same 12MP sensor with built-in f/1.8\naperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS).  \n\u2022 \u200eThe biggest changes come on the video side of things with 4K recording now\navailable at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - both of which are\ndouble the iPhone 7 and the former is a first for any smartphone.  \n\u2022 \u200eI tried it out in a variety of different lighting conditions, indoor and\nout, and\u00a0were impressed with the camera's capabilities - in particular when\nlow lighting is involved, something our iPhone 8 struggled to cope with. This\nis aided by the always-on HDR, which increases saturation while retaining more\nnatural and realistic colours than images shot on the Note 8, for example.  \n\u2022 \u200eThe biggest changes are seen on the video side,\u00a0with 4K recording now\navailable at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - double what the\niPhone 7 has on offer.  \n\u2022 \u200eOn the front of the phone you'll find a 7MP camera f/2.2 aperture, Retina\nFlash and 1080p video recording,\u00a0and while this isn't as great in low-light as\nthe rear-facing snapper, it's perfectly good enough for the occasional selfie\nand Snapchatting, or whatever it is you kids get up to. Unfortunately,\nhowever, you don't get Apple's new Portrait Mode on the iPhone 8, nor the new\nPortrait Lighting feature that the iPhone 8 Plus has.  \n  \n\u2714\ufe0f BATTERY LIFE:  \n\u2022 According to Apple, the battery inside the iPhone 8 will\u00a0last around two\nhours longer than the iPhone 7's, despite weighing in slightly smaller at\n1,821mAh.This has proved accurate during my time with the iPhone 8 so far. It\nusually gets me to the end of the day - just, whereas I usually had to charge\nmy iPhone 8 most evenings.  \n\u2022 \u200eIt's much less of a hassle to charge the iPhone 8 too, as it - along with\nthe iPhone X - is Apple's first smartphone to support wireless charging.\nWhat's more, whereas Apple usually requires expensive propriety accessories,\nthe iPhone 8 supports the Qi wireless charging standard, which means it'll\nwork with most third-party charges on the market.  \n  \n\u2714\ufe0f VERDICT:  \n\u2022 In short the iPhone 8 is an excellent phone and there are some great new\neditions to get excited about, such as the inclusion of wireless charging for\nthe first time and Apple's new A11 Bionic CPU, which is benchmarks are\nanything to go by, is the fastest mobile CPU on the market right now.  \n\u2022 \u200eBeyond that, though, the iPhone 8 is an incremental update over last year's\niPhone 7, and its large bezels and three-year-old design mean it does feel\nsomewhat dated compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel XL 2, despite\ncarrying a similarly-expensive price-tag.  \n  \nThank You PEACE..  \n( IF YOU FIND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL PLEASE HIT THE 'HELPFUL YES VOTE')\n\n", "Phone is good except that the call failure is happening very frequently.
