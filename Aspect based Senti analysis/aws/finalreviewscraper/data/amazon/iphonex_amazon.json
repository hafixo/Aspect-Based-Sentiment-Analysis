Have been using it for three\nweeks now and can safely say that this the best phone currently available in\nthe market, with the Pixel XL a distant second.  \n  \nPros:  \n\\- the end to end retina display is absolutely amazing. Apple TrueTone display\nadjusts better than Android phones with changes in ambient light  \n\\- software: iOS 11.2.5 is very user friendly and intuitive. My phone hasnt\never lagged or stuttered so far.  \n\\- pretty good battery backup (easily lasting for an entire day on normal\nusage)  \n\\- FaceID is a whole new ball game and apple wins it hands down. It is\nextremely accurate and easy to use and unlocks your phone as fast as\nfingerprint and even works in the dark. It is also secure as it checks if you\nare looking at the phone before performing a FaceID action. This is by far the\nbest feature I felt on iPhone X and is a class apart from android phones.  \n\\- the camera is really good in daylight and has a host of new features which\nincludes portrait mode.  \n  \nCons:  \n\\- I personally dont like the notch at the top and makes the display look a\nlittle ugly.  \n\\- Fast charger is not provided in the box. The charger provided takes very\nlong (~1 hr 45 min) to charge the phone.  \n\\- Earphones provided are not of the best quality.  \n\\- Front camera is pretty average and doesnt take exceptional pictures under\ndim lighting conditions.  \n  \nThat said, iPhone X is overpriced and is definitely not value for money. But\nif you are willing to shell off money to get the best phone in the market then\nthis is what you should buy.\n\n", "Marvellous but cost is too high\n\n", "Best thing Apple has ever made.

After spending so much I am unable to use the phone for its basic\nfeature.....making calls!! After speaking with Apple customer care for over 2\nhours I am yet to receive a solution which may take 2-3 days! But come on!!!\nIt's the basic function of a phone!  \nMy worst purchase ever!\n\n", "I like this phone\n\n", "I was an android user since 2011. I always kept iPhone away while buying a new\nphone. My primary concern while selecting a smartphone is the Camera. And my\nprevious Xperia and Samsung flagships served well in that purpose. This time I\nhave short listed Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone X. Since the price difference\nbetween both of them are small and the lags on my last android phones\ncompelled me to buy iPhone X. I have previously used iPhone 5S and 6 Plus for\na short period. Both were 16gb and I returned to Android phones due to limited\nsharing options and lack of extra storage.  \nSpeaking of iPhone X, it is beautiful, heavy weighted, elegant by looks. The\nperformance is very fast, the camera is just awesome. There is ton of iPhone X\nreviews on YouTube/internet so I am not going to review it here.I am just\nsharing some pros and cons according to my usage  \n  \nProtection Tips :-  \nCase :- I brought a SPIGEN Neon Ultra Hybrid Crystal case as that provides\nsolid drop protection as well as has silver lining that matchs well with\nsilver color of my phone  \n  \nScreen Protector :- Here i brought MTT it has all the usual features some\npeople may also go for the full body protection that even protects the top\nnotch but that might add bulk but hey that's my opinion .  \n  \nPros:  \n:- Super fast  \n:- Elegant & beautiful design.  \n:- Large screen of 5.8 inch.  \n:- Good battery backup. Lasts full day on heavy usage.  \n:- Facial Recognition (Face ID)  \n:- Great photos both day light and low light.  \n:- Quad LED flash  \n:- Very good portrait photos. (Stage light is a hit or miss all other mods\nwork beautifully)  \n:- 10X optical zoom using Dual 12mp cameras.  \n:- Great quality, loud sound.  \n:- Fastest Processor A11 Bionic  \n:- 7mp front camera.  \n:- Awesome 240FPS slow-motion videos in 1080p  \n:- Great video quality  \n:- Stainless steel body  \n:- Wireless charging.  \n:- Not much heating.  \n:- Highest Display Brightness of 574 nits ( Samsung Galaxy note 8 has 408\nnits)  \n:- Best in class OLED as said by \"Display Mate\"  \n:- The new swipes gestures are really intuitive , they have a natural and\nsimple flow to them  \n:- Best video recording , as for still photos it falls just behind google\nPixel 2 ( not much )  \n:- First Bezel less design iPhone  \n  \nCons:  \n:- Very high price when compared to other countries  \n:- Very large & heavy. It is very difficult to hold for long time. Hands get\nhurts.  \n:- Large Screen make one handed operation difficult.  \n:- Apple's new image & video format is not supported by most devices.  \n:- No complete file manager.  \n:- No dedicated headphone jack. We should keep a Bluetooth headphone to use\nwhile charging.  \n:- Limited sharing functionality.  \n:- Un grouped notifications are annoying.  \n:- IOS 11 is buggy and there is an update each weak.  \n:- No fast charging adapter (We can charge using fast charging power bank or\nother phones adapter though)  \n:- Same Design as android abet the notch  \n:- The back glass gonna break easily.  \n:- We have to use a thick case to protect the camera due to camera bump.  \n:- The stainless steel body is prone to a lot of scratches  \n:- battery percentage not shown up have to scroll down to see it hope IOS\nupdate will provide option  \n  \nI have attached some photos taken using my iPhone X.

Amazon services are excellent too.\n\n", "I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would\nlike a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the\nintroduction.  \n  \nThe transition:  \nNO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little\nnotch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone\nto be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself\nannoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky.\nSwitching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so\neasy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything\nfeels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new\ninterface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second\nnature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it\nwas initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without\nan issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top\nparts of the screen without moving your hand).  \n  \nFace ID:  \nI was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does\nhowever learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add\nthat data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time\nand on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean\nover my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has\ngotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need\nto wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's\nunlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really\nenjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the\nability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then\nenter my fingerprint/passcode.  \n  \nIt's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has\naccess to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good\ntrack record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business\n(hello Google & Facebook).  \n  \nWhat I love:  \n\\- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with\nblack wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see\nthe notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).  \n\\- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic\nand makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user\nexperience and I have not had any issues with it.  \n\\- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was\ntoo big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X\nremedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form\nfactor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one,\ncheck one out at a local store.  \n\\- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old,\nbut the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I\ncan easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself\nfeels smooth.  \n\\- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a\nlike on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more\nthree-dimensional in a way.  \n\\- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in\nportrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a\nDSLR camera.  \n\\- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for\nimpromptu music listening.  \n\\- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It\nfeels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.  \n  \nWhat I don't:  \nHonestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint\nthat comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in\nsome apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have\noptimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far\nbetween.\n\n", "This phone carries with itself great hype and consequently great expectations.\nIn my experience, having had both the 8 plus and this, the main perceivable\ndifferences between both are in the size, the edge to edge display, front\ncamera portrait mode, the absence of the home button, the new UI gestures and\nof course FaceID. How well are these implemented?  \n  \n\u2022 UI gestures- The new way of navigation is very well implemented and I have\nnot experienced any difficulties in adapting to or using them The swipe up\ngesture to go home, swipe right and hold for multitasking etc are really easy\nand intuitive. People have been complaining about the control centre now a\nswipe down from the top right corner. But I ask how is this different from the\nnotifications and quick toggle on Android which is also a swipe down from the\ntop? With the new breed of 18:9 screen aspect ratio Android phones which are\ntaller than ever before, this gesture is none the easier. I give it a score of\n7.5/10  \n  \n\u2022 FaceID- Works like a charm. The sensors are very forgiving of the angle but\nit won\u2019t work if you\u2019re holding your phone upside down or sideways. Apart from\nthat, it works very well. It has a wide range of view. You don\u2019t have to be\ndead centre in front of the phone for it to unlock. Works with sunglasses and\nspectacles and has no problem either in pitch dark or bright sunlight as long\nas the sun is not on your face or behind you. Prospective buyers shouldn\u2019t\nhave any apprehensions regarding it. Apple has given us a very good\nalternative to TouchID. It scores 8/10  \n  \n\u2022 Front camera portrait- Nothing special. You have to try several times for it\nto give an acceptable result. Doesn\u2019t compare well with the Pixel 2 phones.\nYet, the skin tones on the iPhone are always far more natural than its Android\ncounterparts. Doesn\u2019t deserve more than 6/10  \n  \n\u2022 OLED Display- You really have to look for differences between the IPS LCD of\nthe 8 plus and the X. Apple does such a good job with the calibration of their\ndisplays that, frankly, I don\u2019t see much difference in the quality of colours\nbetween the OLED iPhone X and the LCD 8 plus. Yes the OLED has more contrast\ncompared to the LCD but if you\u2019re looking to buy a phone purely for the punchy\nsaturation and vividness of an OLED display, this is not it. You\u2019d do well to\nlook at the Samsung Note8. Apple always favours colour accuracy over\nvividness. The display quality deserves an 8/10  \n  \n\u2022 Battery life is better than the 8 but worse than the 8 plus. There\u2019s no\ncompetition. If you\u2019re a heavy user, you will not get a full day\u2019s use out of\nit. Plus, charging it is even slower than the 8 plus as the battery is\nactually bigger in size. Wireless charging is on board but is very slow in my\nexperience. I have the Samsung fast charger that comes with the Note8 and use\nit to charge this phone. The battery scores 6/10.  \n  \n\u2022 Animoji- Fun if you spend too much time messaging people on iMessage. The\nnovelty of it will wear off. The problem is that Apple has made us think it is\nsome futuristic cutting edge tech built into its TrueDepth sensors when it\nactually isn\u2019t. It is just using the front camera for face tracking and\nthere\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be ported over to the 8 or older iPhones. But\nwe know that is never going to happen. Apple will keep updating new characters\nto keep Animoji interesting. I give it a 5/10 because it is marketed as\nsomething which it isn\u2019t.  \n  \nMY SCORE - 6.75/10  \n  \n\u2022 FAQs-  \n1- How is the size and in-hand feel?- The size of the phone is much more\nmanageable in one hand. The screen is narrower and gives less screen space\nthan the plus model. It feels solid and premium in the hand. No creaking\nsounds yet.  \n  \n2- How bad is \"The Notch\"? - Doesn\u2019t bother me anywhere outside Youtube videos\nor other video streaming platforms. It does cut into the video if you decide\nto expand the video to make full use of the available screen. It\u2019s not\nnoticeable in general usage like browsing, social media or messaging.  \n  \nCONCLUDING THOUGHTS- In my experience, one has to look at both the iPhone\n8/8plus and the iPhone X in isolation to fully appreciate them. If one spends\ntime comparing them, they\u2019re bound to feel frustrated as there are far too\nmany similarities to justify the huge price difference. If you\u2019re someone who\nmust have the shiniest offering from Apple, then the X is for you. But, if you\nwant bang for your buck, then go for the 8 plus, as it is pound for pound the\nbetter phone between the two. The differences are simply not enough to justify\nspending extra. The camera performance, processor, RAM, storage options, apps,\nsoftware features are the same and the X doesn\u2019t offer as many extras that\nmake it stand apart from its sibling. Maybe next year, Apple?  \n  \nIS IT WORTH IT?- There won\u2019t be a cop out here. If you're contemplating\nbetween this and the 8 plus, in my opinion, to buy this phone, this year, at\nthis price, is not worth it. (My purchase price was 87.5k). Even if you can\nafford it, or have an iPhone above the 6s/Plus, you can skip it without much\nremorse. iPhone 7/7 plus are still great phones and if you can hold off\nanother year, then the 2018 lineup of iPhones is shaping up to be pretty\nexciting. Compared to the iPhone 8 plus, all the features this phone offers\neither looked at in isolation or even as a whole, do not justify getting it.\nGoing forward, all iPhones are going to be designed like this and improve upon\nit. It\u2019s not a limited edition model which is a must have.  \n  \nIf this is going to be your first iPhone or if you're looking to upgrade from\nan iPhone 6 or 6s, go ahead. It is a great phone and you won't regret getting\nit.  \n  \nI have put photos of the phone here. For the camera samples, please see my\niPhone 8 plus review as there is no difference in photo quality between the\ntwo.
