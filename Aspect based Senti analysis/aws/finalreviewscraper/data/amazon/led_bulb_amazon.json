I installed\nanother one outdoors where it is ON for the whole night  \n\u25cf This has got a Lumens Output of 91.7 which means it consumes less\nelectricity. However, there are other bulbs available with Lumens Output close\nto 100  \n\u25cf There is a warning label that this should not be used in completley closed\nlight fixtures. It is bacause of the electronics involved that will need\nventilation to sink away the heat. Eventhough there is another label that says\nthis is for indoor use only, I have been using this for the last two weeks\noutdoors without any issues  \n\u25cf The bulb has got 1 year warranty from the date of purchase. To claim\nwarranty, you would need the invoice from Amazon  \n\u25cf I paid Rs.519 in Feb-17 which is Rs.130 per bulb and I rate FIVE stars. I\nwill update this review after a few month's usage on the durability and\nperformance  \n  \n** LED Bulb Buying Guide **  \n\u25cf Eventhough there are many parameters that you can look for like Lumens\nOutput, Power Factor, Colour Rendering Index, Colour Temperature, LED Life,\netc. while choosing the right LED bulb, if you look at the below three\nparameters it will do good in making a better choice  \n\u25cf Lumens  \n\\- The more the lumens, more the brightness. To get a rough idea on\nbrightness, I have listed the equivalent CFL and Incandescent bulbs that can\nproduce a listed Lumen  \n\\- 450 lm: 8-12 watt CFL; 40 watt Incandescent  \n\\- 800 lm: 13-18 watt CFL; 60 watt Incandescent  \n\\- 1200 lm: 18-22 watt CFL; 80 watt Incandescent  \n\\- 1700 lm: 23-30 watt CFL; 100 watt Incandescent  \nThis will help you decide on the Lumen that you need for your bulb  \n\u25cf Colour Temperature  \n\\- Cool Light: Higher Colour Temperatures (above 3600K) are considered cool.\nCool light is good for office spaces, shopping centers, ertc. since it can\ngenerate higher contrast. Eventhough most of the cool bulbs now available are\nmore than 5500K, the most comfrtable for our eyes is between 3600-5000K  \n\\- Warm Light: Lower Kelvin temperatures (2600 - 3100K) are considered warm.\nThese are slightly yellowish and warm light suits homes since it is more\nflattering to skin tones and clothing  \n\u25cf Lumens Output  \n\\- This indicates how efficient a bulb is. This can be calculated by dividing\nthe rated Lumens by the Wattage. For eg. this Wipro bulb has 825 lumens and 9\nwatt; so Lumens Output is 825/9 = 91.7  \n\\- Bulbs with Lumens Output less than 75 is average, 75-90 is good and 90-100\nis the best  \n\\- There are many bulbs currently available with Lumens Output of 100  \n  \n** Summary **  \n\u25cf If you need more brightness, pick a bulb with more Lumens  \n\u25cf Select Warm Light for living rooms, bedrooms, etc. and Cool Light for\nkitchen, outdoors, etc.  \n\u25cf A bulb with more Lumen Output will consume less electricity than other bulbs  \n\u25cf So, after shortlisting different brands of bulbs with your required Lumens\nand colour temperature, buy the bulb with more Lumen Output and comparatively\nless price  \n\u25cf Lumens, Colour Temperature and Wattage will be printed on the packing carton\nof LED bulbs.\n\n", "I have received the product today - pack of 4. Observations are below:-  \n  \n.. Bulb boxes were damaged  \n  \nThe product specification indicates 3223 Lumens (\"Bulb Base: B22, Color\nTemperature: 6500K, Lumens: 3224lm\") while the details on the bulb case shows\n825 lumens . Refer picture uploaded here. Not sure if I had received the right\nproduct\n\n", "Poor quality.  \nI expected better from PHILIPS.  \nI ordered 8 bulbs (2x4) and I receive 4 poor quality bulbs and 4 comparatively\nbetter quality bulbs.  \nAmazon never provided on door delivery.  \nI always had to go with my bike ( Extra Expense).  \nVery sadly one of the bulbs just gave a blink and never worked again.  \nSince 7 other bulbs are working properly, I decided not to return the whole\npackage.  \nIt\u2019s disgusting to go through all return processes. That\u2019s not what we expect\nfrom online shopping ( a disgusting week).  \nLuminous intensity is same as other brands with same power ratings in the\nmarket.  \nMade of plastic except the heat sink.  \nI opened and examined the faulty bulb and saw a bad capacitor and from my\npersonal opinion heat sinking arrangements could be better.  \nWarranty offered is useless.  \nAmazon is selling for 50% off . What\u2019s the point in it. It is the market value\nand from this experience I realise that I could have brought better product\nfrom local market.\n\n", "This is neither a review nor a statement. When i have decided to change my\nhome lighting and aesthetics, I have gone through many websites looking for a\nbetter and healthy lighting system. After hours of research into LEDs, CFLs,\nincandescent and fluorescent lights, the conclusion is what I felt like\nsharing with.  \nI try to be as objective and as simple I can be rather sounding technical.  \nIt seems that  \nthe LEDs may cause blindness over a long period of time.  \nCFLs may generate UV radiation also are hazardous considering the internal\ninert gases and the mercurial vapour.  \nIncandescent bulbs are relatively better but they consume more power\nunfortunately. Also few reports say that they raise cataract issues over a\ntime, but the high raise of cataract cases of the 80s,90s is due to sudden\nincrease of exposure to light due to electrification etc( as our grandparents\nare more dependent on sun for light and eyes used to get ample relaxation &\nrejuvenation time).  \nThe reason why all the light sources have got some or other problems is\nbecause that all these are artificial sources of light. So this artificial\nprocess of recreation of light is against the natural form is the vital reason\nbehind making it harmful for long exposures.  \n  \nSo I have read more and realized that if the lights can be put in any casings\nlike glass shields or such decorative jars which not only enhance aesthetics\nbut also reduce the harmful effects of light.  \nSo don't use any bulbs directly as a light source. Don't let them be naked,\nadd some colorful clothes to them :P or add translucent shields so that\ndissipates the light uniformly and takes at least 50-60%. of negative effects\nof artificial lighting. Also the placing of the light source and the wall pain\ncolour etc are other things to enhance lighting and to reduce the dependency\non higher lumens.  \nJust google yourself to realise the negative effects, if you don't trust in\nsome strangers free piece of advice :P.  \n  \nThis piece of writing is just to share my views and not against any product or\ncompany.  \nThe reason behind one star is my opinion against artificial lighting and its\nill effects but not for the particular products. The products are of good\nquality and many of them work efficiently.  \nBe rational and conscious, rather falling for consumerism.  \nStay healthy.  \nHope this info is helpful.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0a\n\n", "is this bulb original...\n\n", "As I go through reviews of Philips , crompton Greaves, syaska & Everyday ,\nthere is good & bad reviews , atlast I decided to go with philips  \nNone of these company get above 4 star rating , between 3 to 4* depends on\nreviewer level  \n  \n4 bulbs for Rs 354 nice deal  \n  \nGlowing well good for mid sized room  \n  \nBuy it , everything depends on your luck \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\n", "Bought this a few days back and i would say i have mixed feeling for my\ndecision.
