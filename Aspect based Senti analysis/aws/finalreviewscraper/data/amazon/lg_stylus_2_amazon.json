I\ngave it 3 star due to some drawback.  \n  \nThe positive side of Lg stylus 2:  \n1\\. Awesome look. I just fall in love by its look. Its slim & stylish. It\nwould add a classy effect in your hand.  \n  \n2\\. Camera quality is brilliant. It would give a good competition to iphone\n5s.  \n  \n3\\. Easy to use. Not that complicated as Xperia.  \n  \n4\\. Battery back is too good. The phone would not switch off even in 4%\ncharge.  \n  \n5\\. The speaker sound quality is good.  \nHeadphone is nice as well.  \n  \n6\\. 5\"7 inch screen would made ur experience of watching videos positive.  \n  \nNow the negative side.  \n  \n1\\. Do not have call recording facility.  \n2\\. You cannot screenshot.  \n3\\. It some time becomes too heat but cools down fast as well. But it might be\na probldm for the heavy users.  \n4\\. After using 3 month it sometimes getting hang.  \n  \nOverall I'm loving this phone but it did not reach up to my expectation. But\nin this price range it is worth buying.  \n  \nRegards  \nJayesmita\n\n", "What to say! Phone is stylish. Camera is average, mainly because the picture\nquality does not reflect the megapixels. The stand by mode is devil in\ndisguise, as it requires me to perform a hard restart by pulling out the\nbattery every morning. Android Marshmellow does not seem to be a good OS for\nthis model. I am looking forward to downgrading to upgrading it to see if that\nmakes any difference. Android phones are like so open and so full of features,\nthat it looks messy to me.  \nThe flip cover makes it look stylish with the side view options, else I\nexpected a lot from the this phone considering this being a good config phone.\n\n", "Helo all..i m hardcore fan of Lg mobiles due to the basic features of their\nmobiles and wonderful UI..I bought this mobile 3 weeks back for my wife..this\nmobile is good for its size,light weight,awsom sound clarity,superb battery\nlife, user interface..the only cone i had faced is the screen resolution..its\nvery bad..although its and HD screen,i can feel pixelation on the\nscreen..fotos seems to pixelate...my final verdict is to go for this mobile if\nur requirement is only a basic camera and an awsom mobile..pls.go for it..i\nwould stil recommend this fon to people..because this is such a practical\nmobile which every body wil love to have..thank u all..LIFE IS\nGOOD...laaaalalllllaaaallaaaa..\n\n", "nice phone...... though higher specifications are available in other brands\nlike vivo and oppo....  \nBut going with the brand ths is a very good phone.  \nfast operating  \ncamera is superb  \ntouch is very sensitive  \nAnd wish loved ones with a card prepared by you on your phone  \nNo complaints with the phone\n\n", "Bought the phone with avendor a week back it dose every thing a smart phone\nhas to do good batery android 6 is smooth.
