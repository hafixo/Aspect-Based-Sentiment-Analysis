It\nwould add a classy effect in your hand.  \n  \n2\\. Camera quality is brilliant. It would give a good competition to iphone\n5s.  \n  \n3\\. Easy to use. Not that complicated as Xperia.  \n  \n4\\. Battery back is too good. The phone would not switch off even in 4%\ncharge.  \n  \n5\\. The speaker sound quality is good.  \nHeadphone is nice as well.  \n  \n6\\. 5\"7 inch screen would made ur experience of watching videos positive.  \n  \nNow the negative side.  \n  \n1\\. Do not have call recording facility.  \n2\\. You cannot screenshot.  \n3\\. It some time becomes too heat but cools down fast as well. But it might be\na probldm for the heavy users.  \n4\\.
