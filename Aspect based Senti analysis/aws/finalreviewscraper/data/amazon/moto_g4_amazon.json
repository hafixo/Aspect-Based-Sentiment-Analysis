Now at this price it's the best option for me.  \nOverall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing.

Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting\nfact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.  \nCamera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.  \nIf any questions about this phone.. comment here\n\n", "Excellent phone best buy in 12000.
