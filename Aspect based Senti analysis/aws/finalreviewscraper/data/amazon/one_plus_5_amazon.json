It also holds up good for games such as asphalt 8 and modern\ncombat 5  \n  \n2\\. CAMERA  \nThe camera is amazing. It can take great portrait pictures . A professional\nphotographer will truly love this phone. Even in darkness the camera works\njust fine  \n  \n3\\. PERFORMANCE  \nThis phone can do amazing multitasking. It can smoothly run 5 - 10 apps\nwithout any lag. This is especially useful if someone uses this phone\ncontinuously for hours.  \n  \n4\\. SECURITY  \nThe fingerprint sensor is the fastest I've seen.

It is bezel-less and the display\nis truly amazing.

However these vary\nfrom person to person . Some which i found with this phone are -  \n1\\. Due to the phones size the fingerprint sensor is a bit hard to reach  \n  \n2.the feel of the phone is a bit different and so adjusting will take a week's\ntime  \n  \nThis phones scores in all areas and i feel this could really change the tide\nin mobile phones in the near future\n\n", "I am writing this review after using this phone for 15 days.

Battery Back up is decent can run for 1.5 days on single charge with\nmedium usage.  \n5\\. No heating issue even after heavy usage.  \n6\\. Amoled Display notification is cool & look nice.  \n7\\. Rear Camera is superb in daylight condition.  \n8\\. Fingerprint Sensor is fast & surprisingly Face unlock is also super fast.\n(wasn't expected that much accuracy for Face Unlock before buying)  \n9\\. One of the best advantage is OP team listen to their customer for any BUG\nor Feature improvement & provide update frequently.  \n  \nCons.  \n1\\. Potrait mode not available in front camera.  \n2\\. Speaker could have been better in this price.  \n3\\. It should have at least IP67 rating.  \n4\\. One Basic in built music player should be added in Oxygen OS.  \n  \nOverall in this price range my rating for this phone is 9.6 out of 10.  \nThose who are willing to buy a mid range phone which have all the quality of\nFlagship Phone go for it without any 2nd Thought, you will not regret.  \nIf your main priority is Camera & can spend some extra buck should try for\nPixel or Galaxy S8.

They only have chrome cast. And after trying hard I can't\nconnect/screen mirror it to my Sony Bravia TV.  \n  \nApart from these two the phone is good the performance of phone is better than\nlatest iPhone.

The face unlock is absolutely stunning, better & faster than iPhone\nX. It also works in complete dark areas. The finger print sensor at back is\nquite handy.

This phone is crazy fast.  \nThe AnTuTu benchmark score is 208809  \nCamera is good and it's better than Iphone. Can't compare it with Sony\nflagship phones even though it has got Sony lens.  \nFastest Face recognition ever  \nBattery life is awesome  \nDash charging is simply great!  \nThis phone never ever slows down on heavy usage and there is no heating issue.  \n  \nCheck out for protection cover in Dbrand India. It's awesome, you can\ncustomize the back cover as you wish.\n\n", "Brilliant all round phone... Excellent performance, display is superb and a\ngood camera for the price point.. Face unlock works surprisingly awesome\n\n", "An excellent phone. I upgraded to oneplus 5T from S5 and the new larger\ndisplay + increased speed is a breath of fresh air. Great phone and excellent\nvalue for money. The Star Wars customization was what tipped the scale for me\nas I weighed buying a similarly priced android phone from different companies.\n\n", "The OnePlus 5T is clearly a winner in all aspects.  \nI've been getting consistent 26-30hr battery performance (Location permanently\nset to high accuracy, switching between 4G and WiFi, medium to heavy usage),\nthe screen looks great and performance is on par with the flagships(if not\nbetter).  \nThe camera could be better but is good enough for everyday shots.  \nIt's a clear, reliable and stylish choice for people looking for high end\nperformance at an affordable price.\n\n", "This is the most perfect android device out there which can compete with an\niPhone (switching from apple, as am not happy with iOS11).  \nEverything about the device is awesome except for the low light camera\nperformance, which is also not bad compared to other phones at this range. but\nsince they claimed it to have it improved so much with that secondary camera i\nhad high expectations and it was a bit let down.  \n  \nApart from that I am glad i waited a while for this one. definitely\nrecommended as an happy customer.\n\n", "The phone is the best I have ever come to use.  \nThis has a great camera and everything is just so perfect and smooth, the\ndesire to use this phone is uncontrollable.  \nThe phone has 3500 Mah battery, which due to the large screen size, struggles\nto pass through the day and gives a screen ON time of about 6 hours at low\nbrightness. But, the dash charge compensates for that high speed reduction of\nbattery.  \nWish that this phone had a bit more bigger battery.  \nRest! This phone is the best!\n\n", "Rated the best value for money phone of 2017 and deservedly so.  \n  \n\u2022 Vivid and sharp AMOLED display  \n\u2022 Wonderful battery life  \n\u2022 Dash charging is amazing  \n\u2022 Face Unlock (though not new to Android) works extremely fast and well in a\nwide range of lighting  \n\u2022 Android Oreo about to come to the OnePlus 5T  \n  \nOverall a very good buy for the mid range price bracket providing a near high-\nend experience.\n\n", "Overall Nice Device.  \n  \nGood points:  \nExcellant Performance,  \nNice battery backup  \nDisplay is good.  \n  \nBad points:  \nCamera picture on dim light is not very good\n\n", "Timely delivered.  \nThe phone comes with super clear large display.

The phone is having Soo many awesome features but one\nwhich makes this phone so unique is the charging speed it charges too much\nfast and drains battery really slow so the phone is really good in any sort of\nemergency this. OP5T gets a little bit warm than others that is because of the\nover clocked CPU and it's warmth is almost unnoticeable. The is also really\ngood for gaming too which means this phone can run any game on it and by any I\nmean any game (fortnite is also coming soon for mobile). Also it has also\nreceived Android Oreo update so enjoy the latest OS. At last let me mention\nthe camera it takes beautiful pictures. The sound quality is also good not the\nbest but not bad either. Overall people might think that it's an expensive\nphone but something you need to realize is that the features like 8 GB RAM ,\nSnapdragon 345 , Aderno GPU , fast face and finger print unlock, 6 inch AMOLED\ndisplay, 3300 mAh battery , ultra super hyper speed charging speed you can get\nall these features in any other phone for minimum RS 70000 and One Plus 5T is\njust RS 38999.  \nAlso for a side note my OP5T is Star Wars Edition.\n\n", "Fantastic phone , its really a flagship killer . The phone is extremely fast ,\nand the camera is just awesome including the portrait mode and slow motion\nvideo recording.  \nIts really a compiditor to Samsung flagship products and iPhone.  \nBut only one cons of this phone is that the portrait mode is not that much\nefficient in low light conditions , however its not a major factor . Its\nreally a fantastic phone special the built quality and the processor , its\njust fav.  \nI love this phone\ud83d\udc93\n\n", "Brilliant phone. Really snappy. Its been a smooth experience since i bought\nit. It comes with a pre applied screen protector and and a black translucent\nback cover as well. Best part is the dash charge.it charges 0 to 100 in around\n50 mins. And the battery is big enough to last an entire day.\n\n", "Hi guys , I have been using OnePlus 5T from 11 days ..it is beast phone and\nworking very nicely..i am very sure that OnePlus 5t wins hearts which every\nandroid company doesn't.. My choice is 128gb mid night black..  \n  \nPros.  \n01\\. 18:9 full bezeless display.  \n02\\. Protrait mode works nicely.  \n03\\. Face locking.  \n04\\.

It\nis a slim phone.I like the camera too.  \nIt's speed is also good. Overall I am happy with the phone. I don't know how\nit will perform in the long run. Dashcharge is not that quick but it is ok.I\nbought in Amazon prime and I got in two days.
