Every Pro gamer\nmust require to master this technology. To fulfill the need RedGear has\nlaunched its own series of gamepad. Though most of their gamepad are worth\nbuying but nothing beats the ease and comfort of this gamepad.  \nThe product is not new but still it is one of its best in its series. I have\ntried many other gamepad but nothing beats this gamepad. The product give its\nbest in its price range. It gives an edge over most of its competitors at the\nsame price range.  \n  \nThis controller goes after the Xbox360 design, so casual gamers who are on a\ntight budget can enjoy an alternative gamepad with a price tag of Rs.999  \n  \n================  \nBOX CONTENTS :-  \n================  \n\u2022 Gamepad.  \n  \n\u2022 Micro USB cable.  \n  \n\u2022 Driver Cd.  \n  \n\u2022 A Quick Manual.  \n  \n\u2022 USB receiver.  \n  \n========  \nPROS:-)  \n========  \n\u2022 Cheaper than the Xbox360.  \n  \n\u2022 It is wireless.Clutter free.  \n  \n\u2022 Excelent Range.  \n  \n\u2022 Average Battery life.  \n  \n\u2022 Xinput controller.  \n  \n========  \nCONS:-(  \n========  \n\u2022 Multiple wireless device on the same frequency disturbs the signal resulting\nin laggy gameplay.  \n  \n\u2022 No bluetooth, so android phones will need an OTG.  \n  \n\u2022 Service Centers are in limited regions.  \n  \n\u2022 No application to change the sensitivity of the LT and RT buttons.  \n  \n\u2022 Micro USB provided is only for charging purposes. You cannot use it in Wired\nMode.  \n=============  \nFEAUTURES :-  \n=============  \nOne of the many things I love about this controller is that it not only looks\nlike an Xbox360, it is an Xinput controller, where your PC detects it as a\ntypical xbox controller, so you dont need to configure using 3rd party\napplications to fool your gaming rig that it is an Xbox controller.  \n  \n==================  \nWIRELESS RANGE :-  \n==================  \nYes it is wireless using RF signals at 2.4 ghz no bluetooth so it isnt exactly\na solo device. You need to hook it up with a USB receiver. The Range is\nexceptional for users who want to buy this for a couch play in your mancave or\nliving room. But tends to lag in gameplay when you have multiple wireless\ndevice using the same frequency causing signal interference.  \n  \n===============  \nBATTERY LIFE :-  \n===============  \nThe company says 10 hours. Now i havent been able to test that but for casual\ngamers such as me, i charge it after 3 days with 2 hours of gameplay under the\nbelt.  \n  \nThe charging is done by a Micro Usb cable with a duration of 6 hours for a\nfull charge. The LED indicator flashes in charging mode and shows no light\nwhen its full.  \n  \nCan we play it in WIRED MODE?  \nSadly you cant. The gamepad only accepts the cable for charging not for wired\ngaming.  \n  \n==========================  \nDESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY :-  \n==========================  \n\u2022 The gamepad is is of hard plastic with rubberized grips on both ends of the\ngamepad, suitable for persons with sweaty palms.  \n  \n\u2022 The X,Y,A,B keys, Dpad, analogue stick all resemble the Xbox360 controller.  \n  \n\u2022 The vibration is moderate but not at all disappointing. Although its\nessential that you have to install the Driver that came along with the Disk.  \n  \n\u2022 The button press feedback is crisp and on the lighter side. However the\nrubber on the analogue stick has an off chance to wear off with consistent  \ngaming so i suggest to buy thumb grips for longer life.  \n  \n\u2022 The Dpad could have been improved with a round layout to actually feel that\nyou are pressing two buttons for a bidirection control.  \n  \n\u2022 The LED indicator shows you whether it is Xinput mode or Dinput mode.  \n  \n\u2022 The turbo mode here is a toggle button which enables you to simulate rapid\nbutton presses that you can customize on which button you need to  \ndo.  \n  \n\u2022 The X,Y,A,B buttons are backlited.  \n  \n==========  \nVERDICT :-  \n==========  \nIf you are looking for budget friendly gamepad, then look nowhere else. I am\npretty sure it won't disappoint you. Though it will not give you the Feel of\npremium gamepad, but getting one for third price with just one or two less\nfeatures, is a brilliant buy.  \n  \nIt requires xinput to give vibration feedback. The R3/L3 click button feedback\nis not so good. But no complaints for the cost effective controller.  \n  \n[...]  \n.  \n&  \n.  \nYou owe me a Smile :-)\n\n", "For the price this comes in I would say it's not the cheapest but it is worth\nit. If u want a controller which is Xbox kind go for it. The keys are super\ngood except the ones which are labelled as LB, RB ( These are good for usage\nbut for longer play time I would suggest u change your game controls for\nbetter experience). Next the haptic feedback is great and for the price this\ncomes in u cannot expect any more. I got this in a deal for rs 1100.\nErgonomics are top notch and the grip layer in the palm support is like icing\non the cake. Battery backup is great with very low charge time. This product\ncomes with 1 year warranty for manufacturing defects so this ensures your\ninvestment. If you are a game enthusiast and is looking for a gamepad just\ngrab it and you won't regret your purchase. It works on both Android phones\nvia an OTG cable and on computers with a quick paring dongle. It comes with\nlights and different modes which help significantly.\n\n", "Bought it for 999 which was pretty amazing deal and as was the product. Works\nvery fine and is the best in available price range.\n\n", "Good quality gamepad. looks solid and premium. Redgear pro gamepad is best\noption available right now for budget wireless gamepad. it's take 2 hours to\nfully charge. In just single charge its giving me more then 10-12 hours of\nbattery backup. So Battery backup is amazing.  \n  \nRegear pro gamepad is made for windows OS but you can also use this gamepad in\nandroid phones as well. But i try this gamepad in 3 android phone and its only\nworking in 1 phone. This gamepad is perfectly working in Redmi note 4 but in\nstock android phone (Lenovo K8 Note, Lenovo K8 Plus) this gamepad is not\nworking! check out my full review video on YouTube for more info!  \n  \nIf you like my review click on Helpful Button!  \nCheck Out Full Video Review On My YouTube Channel!  \nLink In The Bio!  \nThanks!\n\n", "I gifted this to my boyfriend on his birthday. I don't know anything about\ngaming. The last game that I played was actually Snake Xenia on a Nokia phone.\nGames make me nervous, probably because my hand-eye coordination sucks. Then\nagain, my boyfriend is a gaming addict. I somehow accessed his Amazon account\nand saw his wishlist. I saw this baby as one of the things he wanted. It was\nin my budget and since it was on his wishlist, I assumed that he would like\nit. Thereafter, I ordered this from my Amazon account. How did it end? He\nloved it and he couldn't believe that I could give him something that would\nmake his gaming time more enjoyable. He is happy. So, I am happy. How bou dah?\n\n", "I was looking for a good pc controller for quite some time now. Finally bought\nthis on the recommendation of a friend. A wired xbox controller is more\nexpensive than this. Plugged in the dongle and it connected within 3 seconds\nwith my windows 8.1 laptop.  \n  \nFeels good to hold. Good plastic on the analog sticks. The shoulder buttons\nare great and snappy. They are just the right amount of hardness. The face\nbuttons have the same tactile feedback of the xbox controllers. Button mashing\ngoodness.  \n  \nA full 5 on 5 rating from me. Once I've spent more time using this controller\nI'll update this review with comments on battery life and wireless\nconnectivity. Till then, dear redgear, please keep making more of these value\nfor money products.\n\n", "Those who have Sony W800D tv...this is your must have accessory... played\nasphalt 8 past two days... working smooth...  \nGot it for 1150 from seller Appario.. prompt delivery \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc  \nDon't know why they are selling it for 1600...waited few weeks for it's price\nto drop...some lucky people got it for 999...  \nI don't have much RAM & graphics in my pc... So I'm playing games like\nassassin's Creed black flag & gta sa..  \nThank you Red gear for additional dongle...  \nWhen its price falls below 1200..don't give a second thought...\n\n", "The controller works like a charm with windows PC, all the xbox games for pc\ncan be played and feels pretty good experience.  \nIt is only for Windows PC, although it supports Android but there aren't any\nproper games that are compatible with these controllers and for sony android\ntv the range is not enough as the receiver goes to the back of your tv so it\njust decreases the connectivity and rarely works.  \nI am writing this review after around 3 weeks of usage.  \nI feel at this price point this the best you can get.  \nDon't worry about the quality its good and satisfying.\n\n", "Totally worth the money. In fact, it is better in comparison with the more\nexpensive controllers from Logitech. Since it is a Xbox 360 imitation, the\nergonomics, more or less, remain the same. Build quality is surprisingly good\nfor an imitation and hope it doesn't break down any time soon. In a nutshell,\nthis is a very good wireless controller and if you are looking for one without\nhaving the means to dish out 3-6 thousand rupees for a original Xbox 360 or\nXbox One wireless controller, I would suggest buying this controller.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 18 November 2017", "on 11 October 2017", "on 20 January 2018", "on 6 November 2017", "on 20 November 2017", "on 11 November 2017", "on 5 October 2017", "on 29 January 2018", "on 11 November 2017", "on 2 December 2017"], "reviewer": ["sobhan", "Jeron", "Mahendra Singh", "Gautam", "XInnovator", "Saniya Sharma", "Naman Varma", "Deepasekaran", "Amazon Customer", "Siddhartha K."]},

Also many buttons can be made\nturbo at the same time.  \n4) Able to connect 2 Redgear Pro wireless game pad to computer to play 2\nplayer games  \n5) Never felt to recharge batteries during game play. usually play for 2 hours\nand then mostly it is on charge.  \n  \ncons  \n1) Weighs ~215g. Little heavier on hand.  \n2) In one of the game pad, need to press D-pad little harder. Not a big\nproblem though.  \n3) since D-Pad is not circular, pressing diagonally is little cumbersome. Need\nto practice to press diagonally.  \n4) observed that the game pad can attach to both the wireless receiver. There\ncan be confusion on what Gamepad is player 1 and player 2. The issue is only\nduring power-up and hence not a big problem either.  \n5) One of the usb receiver didn't work more than a meter.
