Received one day before the expected delivery\ndate...thanks amazon for speedy and safe delivery... under 9000 Redmi Mi 4 is\ngood decision to purchase. It almost covered all smartphone features... Finger\nprint is very accurate and fast. Camera is normal but no shutter lag. Nice\ndisplay 3gb ram and 32gb rom is enough for normal user. Battery backup is also\ngood. Music out put is very clear and crispy, but in-built speaker volume is\naverage. Best musical experience by using head set. I tested with JBL 100csi\nand with the help of equillizer settings found awesome sound out put...\nSatisfied with the purchase.... \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n\n", "Excellent configuration for such a price. Sturdy and compact phone. The MIUI\nis very easy to use by elderly people. Camera quality for outdoor photography\nis decent. Having said that, its better to put on a tempered glass , since the\ndisplay isn't a Corning Gorilla. Fingerprint sensor makes it smoother to\nunlock.... no need to give passwords each time.  \nAvoid using fast-chargers to charge this phone to prevent overheating. Battery\nbackup is quite decent. Stand alone battery life in Airplane mode is about\n2-3days (depending on the room temperature). Under heavy usage like YouTube\nstreaming.... it lasts for more than 1-1.5days. Overall a good deal!\n\n", "Delivery: Though it was supposed to deliver before next day 8pm but Amazon\ndelivery was 1 hour late.  \nPhone:  \nBuilt quality: 9/10  \nBattery: 9/10 easily lasts for 2 days if you are a moderate user.  \nInterface: MIUI 8/10  \nRam: you will get around 900mb ram free after first boot.  \nInternal memory: around 8.5 gb free after first boot.  \nGaming performane: good enough. No lag in paying mid range games. Didn't play\nhigh quality games like asphalt.  \nCamera: 6/10 rear camera is pretty good at outer condition. Not good at low\nlight. Front camera not good. Overall average performance.  \nOverall value for money. If you are not into photography and selfies then it's\na must have for you. Go for it.\n\n", "This review is after using it for more than 10 days.  \nDisplay is good.  \nRam management is good.  \nPhone does not lag.  \nHeats up a little during charging.  \nCall quality is excellent.  \nSound Output is average though It's better through headphones.  \nCamera is average.  \nBattery backup is excellent.  \nI purchased black one and it looks premium.  \nOverall a great phone for a reasonable price.  \nP.S- There is a new competitive player in the market and it's Tenor(10.or). If\nyou don't care for brand name , you can go for it.\n\n", "Not what I expected from Xiomi. 3s Prime is far better than Redmi 4. It gets\noberheated, battery backup not good, and it sometimed stops detecting my 2nd\nsim. It even started to restart. I bought it only 1 month back. And it has\nalready started showing problems. Not a pho e I'll recommand you'll to buy.\n\n", "Good looking. It has 5inch screen 1280\u00d7720 pixels resolution.  \nPowered by 1.4GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 435 processor with 3GB RAM and 32GB\ninternal which can be expanded through microSD card up to 128GB.  \nRedmi 4 coupled with 13MP back camera and 5MP front facing camera and runs on\nAndroid 6.0 Marshmallow with 4100mAh battery and weights 150gms.\n\n", "Great product in the price range I have no problems that's good enough for the\nprice I'm getting so much features (4+64) variant  \n1- Awesome processor  \n2- Miui is love  \n3- Huge battery backup  \n4- great look easy to hold sexy design fits in the palm really easily  \n5- camera is by far the best under 10k whichever variant you buy the storage\nand ram will be different but features and hardware same !\n\n", "The glass is not good. It can break easily. Battery lasts 36 hours approx with\nuse for internet. It heats up but not that bad. The phone looks good but the\nfront glass looks bad. Overall fine product. There is no better deal than this\nin the market today. So no choice. As it has many sensors as well as it is 5\ninches.\n\n", "I found some shortcomings while using the Redmi 4.  \n  \n1) The Home key button, Back Key button etc. which given in the lower side has\nno light. If using phone in dark place or night you have no idea where is the\nback key and other keys.  \n  \n2) The volume buttons of the Redmi 4 are very tight. You have to press very\nhardly for making volume up and down.  \n  \n3) I found the speakers both side in phone but only One side of speaker is\nworking. It seems other speaker is given in phone is only for be fooled of\ncustomers.  \n  \n4) The picture quality is not up to the mark as said/presented by MI.\n\n", "I am reviewing this phone in redmi 4. It is a fantastic phone. Great battary\nlife. Awesome touch sensitivity. Processor is great too. Camera perfect. I am\nvery happy with this device.

Redmi 4 is\nalready a long player in the budget smartphone market loaded with competitive\nfeatures and a nice battery. The phone looks good too (doesn't look like a\nbudget smartphone if not informed). What is more interesting is that me and my\nbrother in law have earlier used redmi note 3 together. And now we have four\nredmi 4 smartphones in our family. My mom, my wife, my brother in law and now\nme, each of us are having one redmi 4 as our secondary backup phone.  \n  \nLet me tell you this makes an awesome secondary backup smartphone along with\nyour primary one. The jet black colour suits my taste and gives it a more\npremium look.  \n  \nI am also amazed to find Xiaomi has given us a smartphone with all metal\nanodised aluminium body and a massive battery capacity of 4100 mAh at this\nprice.  \n  \nThe phone runs smooth and lag free even with a mere 2GB of RAM. I think most\nof the credit for this should go to the better performing SD 435 octa-core\nprocessor. The display size of 5\" made it a perfect smartphone to hold\ncomfortably on my palm unlike the larger devices (5.5\"-6\") that tends to slip\nout of your hands often. The fingerprint sensor works fast enough.  \n  \nThe only con I have found till now not only about this smartphone but all\nXiaomi smartphones are the idea of a 'hybrid sim slot' that compels you to\neither run for increasing more space (which you'll do anyway considering this\nhas got a mere 16GB of internal memory) or use a secondary sim, but not\ntogether.  \nAnother con is the camera. I won't say the camera is bad but it is decent,\ngiven the price point. Moreover, I have always felt the photographers should\nrun after a professional camera if they want a perfect camera and should never\nlook for a pro level camera in a smartphone. Smartphones are smartphones, not\nDSLRs.  \n  \nTo sum up, Redmi 4 makes an awesome budget smartphone and deserves to give\nSamsung a run for their money in the low-end budget smartphone segment because\nanyway, Samsung smartphones are pathetic in performance in this segment. And\nof course, it is a perfect gift to have! Thank you Wifey!\n\n", "I am using redmi 4 since last 1 month.Redmi 4 was launched two months ago.it\nis the successor of redmi 3s and 3s prime launched last year.It comes in three\nvariants: (1) 2gb ram+ 16gb storage at \u20b9 6999 ( 2) 3gb ram+ 32gb storage at \u20b9\n8999 and last 3gb ram+ 64gb storage at 10999.Here I am going to review it's\n3gb version-Display: it's screen size is 5 inch, size is low but it is more\nconvenient to use from single hand.it looks very much pretty in your\nhand.Performance: I am using it daily almost 18-20 hours.Mostly I prefer to\nbrowse facebook.You can easily run games like injustice 2 or asphalt 8 or\nmodern combat 5 on it.I found no lag while using this phone.let me talk about\nother phones which are available in market.In this range there is no any other\nbetter option than this phone.Memory: Out of 32gb, 25gb is available for\nstorage.it is sufficient enough for any user.Camera: It comes with 13\nmegapixel rear camera whose performance is satisfactory.There is also a 5\nmegapixel front camera without any flash.Camera performance is satisfactory\nnot good.Battery: It is the segment which is specially highlighted by xiaomi\nin advertisement.It comes with 4100 mAh battery.Battery backup is very nice.\nYou can easily use it for 14 hours continusously on 4g network in single full\ncharge.Fast charging is not supported.Only disappointment regarding this phone\nis that it is not available easily in market.Only few stores in delhi have\nredmi 4 in stock.it is available only online exclusively.\n\n", "4 stars for Redmi 4 mobile and 5 stars for Amazon and its delivery.  \n  \nAbout product : It is the best choice for the price range less than 10k.  \n  \nPros:  \n\\+ Slim and easily operate in one hand. Back cover is very slippery due to\nmetal finish, suggested to use case cover to avoid slipping from hands.  \n\\+ 2.5D curved glass and back cover metalic finish give premium look to the\nmobile.  \n\\+ It supports Jio 4G VoLTE. Voice call clearity is good and no issues with\nnetwork signal or wifi or wifi hotspot.  \n\\+ Good performance with the Snapdragon 435 SoC, didnt feel any lagginess.  \n\\+ Rear camera is 13mp shooter and good quality images in natural lighting.\nNot so great in artificial lighting. Front camera is 5mp and good for selfies.  \n\\+ Supports most of the apps and games.  \n\\+ Good finger print response, very accurate always. Built in security app\nused to lock the apps (using both finger print or pattern/pin), no need of\nthird party apps to lock/protect apps. Antivirus app comes built in, top of\nthat we can use other security protection applications also.  \n\\+ Supports OTG devices. GPS and Compass sensors are giving exact location\ndetails to use in the map.  \n\\+ Good battery backup, solidly it comes 1 to 1.5 days of dual sim (3G+4G),\nfb, whatsapp and checking mails usage, still there will be 25-30% battery left\nat end of the day. Heavy gaming - more than 12 hrs.  \n\\+ Custom friendly UI interface, thanks to MIUI developers.  \n\\+ Some people complaining about heating issues, but I did not feel any\nheating issue even with high graphics game usuage (Asphalt 8, Modern combat).\nFeel that they didnt do regular patch update. I do regular patch update\nimmediately when it comes on OTA, that could be reason that I didnt get\nheating issues.  \n  \nCons:  \n\\- No turbo charger with the package. It has regular 2.0 Amp charger only. We\ncan still use fast charger as the mobile has Snapdragon 435 processor which\nsupports fast charging.  \n\\- No screen production like Gorilla glass 3/4 or Ashahi dragontrail. Within a\nmonth, my mobile got hairline crack in screen for accidental drop from less\nthan one feet hieght. So only they didnt mention anything in description about\nscreen protection.  \n\\- MIUI consumes more RAM. Always it shows 1.5GB RAM usage (out of 3GB) even\nthough when no apps running in background.  \n\\- No regular Android OS version upgrade. Still in Marshmallow based MIUI 8.5.\nReceiving regular MIUI patch update for 3 to 4 months once, but not OS version\nupgrade. Shortly we will get Android orea in other mobiles, but Redmi 4 is far\nbehind and stuck with Marshmallow. It is only problem with MIUI based\nproducts. MI has to think about this.  \n  \nAbout amazon.in and its delivery:  \n\\+ It is great as it is always.  \n\\+ Good packaging.  \n\\+ Delivered even before the estimated.  \n\\+ I bought it in Tuesday flash sale, the product claim went 100% within 2\nminutes, but I was added in the queue for waiting list and placed the order\nwhen my turn comes.  \n  \nThis is review of the Redmi 4 mobile after 6 months usage.\n\n", "Well Happy with the phone.  \nFew things I would like if Xioami improves:  \n1) I've Max 2 and redmi 4, both the phone gets scratches on the screen (you\ncan find on high light) even with normal usage. So immediately get a toghened\nglass.  \n  \n2) MIUI is good OS but can improve notification bar to cop up with Stock\nAndroid. Here, you can not see notification extended details using single\nhand.  \n  \n3) Redmi 4 gets heated with slight heavy usage like hotspot. Battery is not\ntoo good as I found on Max 2.\n\n", "The phone is overall good and nice look with premium metal body.Both the\nCamera's are average.Snapdragon processor is also Average.You will get MIUI 9\nAndroid Nougat 7.1.2 update,RAM management is really nice with MIUI 9 which\nwas worse in MIUI 8.Now the free RAM goes around 1.5-1.7 GB which was\npreviously 1-1.5 GB.Speakers are great for the price.Its 2.5D curved glass so\nfinding appropriate Tempered glass is Difficult I recommend Plus Tempered\nglass which covered full Screen.Overall a good choice\n\n", "Pros.  \n1\\.

So go\nfor it.\n\n", "Mini iphone at the price of only 6999...omg...love that....thanks to\namazon..build quality is excellent...camera is very good..sound is adequately\nloud... display is also very good....i will give 8 oit of 10 to this phone as\na king of this price segment....only cons is that flash sale....it is annoying\n\n", "Just don't care about anyone's neg review.  \nI can gurantee you the phone is better than any other phone in this price\nrange.  \nCamera quality is far better than moto or samsung.  \nOnly issue I found it slightly heating while playing an high graphics game or\nusing camera for a long time.....  \nBut you can overlook this little issue.  \nEvery game is running without a single lag.  \nIts truely a great device...  \nClose your eyes,Go for it!\n\n", "I have been using redmi4 3 gb version mobile for more than a week and my\nexperience is...  \nIt looks beautiful and fit well in the palm. As the display is 2.5D, i use\ntempared glass and cover.(easy to broke the display).The disply visibility in\ndaylight is good. I installed 10 more apps and still it working gently and its\nok(don't think it is fast as redmi note4)..I got 1.7 ram out of 3. The power\nof this phone is its battery. 30 minute call,watch a movie, took some video ,\nuse internet 2 house by mobile network..it costs only 45% of battery there are\nplenty to play..he he..  \nThe primary camera is good at daylight conditions. Amost reflecting good\ncolour and saturation is also pretty well. But in bad light conditions its a\nhard game.but I can say below inr 9000 its camera is better than any other\nmobile..and like any other mobile it is also heating up in heavy usage, but\nstill manageable comapare to its defenders. Any way redmi4 is the best mobile@\ninr9000\n\n", "Great Product.  \nEverything I need in one package.  \n  \nBought 3 such products for the whole family. YAH! Redmi 4 Family.......LOL.  \n  \nSeriously though, good product. No issues till date. It come with MIUI 8 but\nhas now got a MIUI 9 update (downloadable). The best part is the \"dual space\"\nfeature. You can literally separate you contacts & other stuff (if you are\nusing two sim. Its not a default scenario. You have to configure it yourself).\n\n", "Superb phone in this price range  \nHere is the detailed review:  \nCons first-  \n(1) metal back is much slippery , you have to be very careful while holding it\nback cover will obviously make it thicker and you will lose the feel  \n(2) miui is not upto my expectation feels laggy if you are android\nenthusiastic  \n  \nNow Pros:  \n(1) first of all its hold and design, most compact phone for a five inch\ndevice, minimal bezels makes it very handy, if you have small palms like mine\n, this phone is for you, weight is light and curved edges makes it feel\nthinner  \n(2)2.5 d curved glass makes it look very beautiful, screen is HD but looks not\nless than FHD , I have lenovo zuk 2 FHD phone , and I dont find any difference\nin resolution  \n(3) yes miui is pIn for me but if you know how to install custom rom and get\nlineage on it , it becomes a killer phone  \nI am enjoying it..

You'll definitely feel awesome by the feel and touch of this item that too\nat this price change.  \n5\\.

Although ,faster than I expected it to be.  \n-Hybrid sim slot can be a con for some people.As you can't use Two sim cards and 1 memory card at the same time.  \n\\- Speaker- audio bit low.\n\n", "Pros:  \n1\\. Best phone in this price range, I bought it after doing loads of online\nresearch and reading through thousands of reviews and I am not at all\ndisappointed. Go for the 32 GB model priced at 8998, don't buy the 16 GB\nmodel.  \n2\\. This phone looks awesome too, similar to iPhone 6S just without the home\nbutton. Its pretty sleek and stylish.  \n3\\. Camera is pretty good, good colour reproduction in proper light.  \n4\\. Screen quality is good, bright and vibrant. Touch is smooth, accurate and\nfast, no lag.  \n5\\. Doesn't get slow because of the 3 GB RAM, great performance.  \n6\\. Battery life is good, about 1.5 - 2 days if you use wisely and charge\nwisely.  \n7\\. Have not experienced any heating problems so far.  \n8\\. Finger-print sensor is fast and accurate.  \n9\\. MUI on top of Android looks pretty decent and attractive, doesn't slow\ndown the phone. MI has added many extra features on top of Android which are\nuseful for aggressive users like me.  \n  \nCons:  \n1\\. Speaker loudness is bit less, but that shouldn't be a problem. If you want\nto hear very loud music use bluetooth speakers!  \n2\\. Low light photos are bit poor, but better than most mobiles in this price\nrange. It serves the purpose perfectly fine. You can't expect photos like\ndigicam from a budget mobile!  \n3\\. The home, back and menu buttons at the bottom of the phone doesn't glow.\nThis isn't much of a problem as you get used to the keys in a few days and you\nknow where they are.  \n4\\. Some preloaded apps can't be removed. This also doesn't matter much\nbecause the ram and processor is enough to keep the phone running blazing\nfast.  \n6\\. This phone has 2 SIM slots, 1 nano and 1 micro. The micro sim slot is\nhybrid which means you can either insert SIM or Memory Card in it. I hear\npeople complaining about that, which is foolish because 32 GB is a lot and\nthink if you really need memory card even after that!  \nAlso only 1 SIM can have 4G network activated, other will run in 3G/2G which\nshould be also fine because usually only 1 SIM is used for internet (like Jio)\nand other SIM is kept only as a backup number for calling / SMS.  \n  \nVerdict: Buy this mobile blindly if your max budget is 10K.\n\n", "Multipurpose Phone!!  \nEverything is perfect.  \n  \nDesign :-With a unibody metal construction, the Redmi 4 follows the design\nlanguage of Redmi Note 4. There are curved edges with a curved 2.5D glass on\nthe front which aids the ergonomics. The highlight of the design is of course\nthe compact form factor owing to the 5-inch display. It fits quite well in\none\u2019s palms and single-handed usage is a breeze.  \n  \nThe build quality is excellent and it feels solid, and the matte black variant\nlooks great and gives a very premium feel.  \n  \nHowever, the three capacitive buttons behind the display are not backlit. It\nis disorienting at first, but you impulsively know where your thumb needs to\ngo after a few days of usage.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 might be a budget phone but there\u2019s no compromise on the\naesthetics. In fact, with this outing \u2013 like before \u2013 the company sets the\nstandards for what affordable smartphones should look and feel like in 2017.  \nDisplay :-The Redmi 4 sports a 5-inch HD display with a 1280 x 720 resolution.\nThere\u2019s a 2.5D curved glass, similar to the Redmi Note 4. It\u2019s toughened\nglass, although there\u2019s no Gorilla Glass protection  \nThe HD display nevertheless looks fantastic in terms of color reproduction and\nviewing angles. The images and text looks sharp, and it is clearly one of the\nbest displays on smartphones in this price segment. Maintaining a perfect\nbalance, it is a crisp and vivid display without the colors looking\noversaturated.  \nConclusion :-Starting at \u20b96,999 ($108) for the base variant, the Redmi 4 ticks\nall the right boxes and there is hardly anything to complain. It\u2019s a great\npackage with solid chassis, Qualcomm\u2019s newer chipset, decent camera, and great\nbattery life. The only shortcoming of the device is lack of Android Nougat out\nof the box\n\n", "My father owns RN4 which is similar to this R4,fews things are missing in this\nlike  \n-5 inch screen  \n\\- notification light is in bottom  \n\\- no double tap to wake  \n\\- only single white LED light for charging, notification, etc  \n\\- no slow motion video recording  \nBut Overall build quality very good, buttons are sturdy, didn't like hybrid\nslot, (tenor is good in this case) I have Exchanged it with my old Samsung\ngalaxy note 2 for Rs. 2k this is my 3rd phone purchase on Amazon\n\n", "Xiaomi redmi 4 is the company's latest model in the sub-rs 10000/- segment.\nXiaomi has so far seen a string of successes with its redmi range with most\nmodels finding place in our periodic list of the \"Best Budget Phones.This new\nxiaomi redmi 4 will not onlyhave to take on the competition,but also live up\nto its predecessor in a lot of ways, and it certainly seems like an improvment\nwhen it comes to specifications.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 specifications and software  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 features a 5-inch HD (720x1280) IPS display with 2.5D curved-\nedge glass. This seems to be the first time that Xiaomi is using 2.5D glass on\na Redmi smartphone priced below Rs. 10,000. There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery, and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. The phone is powered by an octa-\ncore Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. There are three\nvariants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; one with 3GB\nof RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. Our\nreview unit had 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports\nexpandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).You get a 13-megapixel\nrear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED flash. There's also a\n5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. The new Redmi 4 will support 4G\nand VoLTE along with other connectivity options. When two SIM cards are used,\nonly the primary one will allow 4G calls and data while the secondary SIM\nfalls back to 2G calls only.The phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with\nXiaomi's MIUI 8.2 skin. This is a stable build which is identical to what we\nsaw on the Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4A. This means that the Redmi 4 has a lot of\nsoftware features that we have already seen, including Dual Apps, which lets\nyou create a second instance of any app and supports Facebook, Instagram,\nTwitter, WhatsApp, and more. The Quick Ball feature lets users assign\nshortcuts for features. One-handed mode shrinks the display to one corner of\nthe screen so that everything's easier to reach. The phone also gets a\nscrolling screenshot feature that will let you take screenshot of an entire\nWeb page. Child Mode lets users lock apps, and Second Space creates a separate\nprofile to help users manage business and personal data on the same device.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 camera  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy. Compared to the Redmi 3S Prime, we found that\nautofocus on the Redmi 4 was a bit quicker. Camera samples were detailed and\nsharp, with colours that were vibrant and truly popped. Landscapes had\naccurate colours for the most part as well as reasonable detail. Macro or\nclose-up shots had a slight haze when seen full-size on a desktop monitor,\nthough the HDR mode helped to some extent.  \n  \nUnfortunately, turning HDR mode on made image capturing and processing really\nslow, and this is one of our biggest complaints with the device. With HDR on,\nusers need to be steady for a few seconds to get a good shot, or else photos\ncome out looking awful.  \n  \nThe rear camera has a tendency to capture a lot of noise when there is no\ndirect light source. Some camera sample shots taken in the dark were very\npoorly defined and had too much motion blur. At night, the Redmi 4 managed to\ntake good photos only when we were close to the subject under a light source\nsuch as a streetlamp.The Redmi 4's camera app is minimalistic and easy to use,\nwith controls for various settings and features occupying only a small part of\nthe screen. HDR mode is just a tap away, as are the live filters. The phone\ncan record video at 720p and 1080p, and the videos came out decent overall.  \n  \nSelfies on the Redmi 4 can be an issue if you want a candid one, again because\nimage processing is slow. We ended up with a slew of blurred selfies just\nbecause we wanted to take one quickly. Other than this issue, our sample\nphotos taken in good light had a good amount of detail and decent colour tone.\nIn low light, we had a tough time, and faces came out looking too grainy.  \n  \nOverall, the Xiaomi Redmi 4's cameras are definitely an improvement over those\nof the Redmi 3S Prime (Review), in terms of focusing and results. There are\nfew issues like poor low-light shots and slow processing in HDR mode, which we\nhope can be fixed - or at least improved upon - with updates.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 performance  \nGeneral performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is decent, and the device handled\nmost tasks well. The MIUI interface at times felt sluggish, but this doesn't\naffect performance within apps such as when playing games such as Asphalt 8\nand Cut the Rope 2. We had no major concerns during the entire review period.\nThere was also no noticeable overheating.  \n  \nOur unit had 3GB of RAM, and there was roughly 1.2GB free at any given time,\nwhich means those on the 2GB RAM variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 might struggle\nwith multi-tasking on their units. Despite roughly 1GB of free memory on our\nunit, we didn't have to deal with any crashes or slowdowns, but we would\nrecommend opting for the variant with 4GB of RAM if you can spend a little\nmore.  \n  \nVoice call quality was decent, and the phone supports VoLTE. The phone doesn't\nship with a headset, so we checked the sound quality using our own earphones,\nand were quite impressed. You get several options to tweak music with the Mi\nSound Enhancer feature when using earphones. The Redmi 4 was also able to play\nour assortment of test videos with ease.The 5-inch IPS display is bright and\ntext appears sharp. The screen is crisp with decent viewing angles. However,\nthis isn't the best HD display we've seen on a Redmi phone. Colour\nreproduction is decent, but in our opinion, the Redmi 3S was better. The\nscreen was readable and usable under direct sunlight. Movies and games look\ngood on the 5-inch display, though some might prefer a bigger screen. There's\na Reading mode on the device that reduces background glare. Users can manually\ncontrol colours and saturation on the device through the Settings app.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 scored 43,677 in AnTuTu and 22,996 in Quadrant. We also ran\n3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench, where the phone scored 5,890 points and\n25fps respectively. These scores are on par with those of other phones powered\nby the Snapdragon 430 processor.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 lasted for 14 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test,\nwhich is impressive. We can partly credit the battery loop test performance to\nthe low-impact HD screen resolution. With regular use, the battery lasted over\na day. There are also power saving modes to help squeeze more life out of each\ncharge. The phone doesn't come with a fast charging adapter but Xiaomi's Jai\nMani told us that it does support fast charging. We can expect Xiaomi to sell\na fast charging adapter for the Redmi 4 as an optional accessory, or you could\nbuy a third-party one.\n\n", "Two big problems with this phone:  \n  \n1\\. Its filled with google's bloatware apps with no way to uninstall them.\nThey take up to 20% or RAM. I don't know why we are not allowed to uninstall\nthem.  \n  \n2 [FIXED, the transferred me to superviser who helped me :) ]Whenever I\nconnect it my pc for internet tethering, my pc starts hanging and randomly\nblue screens.
