And She Loved It . Its A good phone from samsung and its\nbeen one year i didnt faced any problem. It has got 2gb ram and 16 gb internal\nstorage which is enough . Also i got android nougat update too. Overall a good\npurchase\n\n", "Best mobile from Samsung in budget range. Best because  \n1) You will get android 7.1.1 version with this device, currently no mobile\nphone from Samsung is running on this OS compared to same price tag.  \n2) You will get Samsung experience version 8.5 which is provided by Samsung\nfor high end devices.  \n3) Other specifications are also better than same price range mobile phones in\nJ series.  \n4) Using from more than 1 year and faced no issue, so if you are planning to\nbuy a stable initial/entry level device then it is best choice.\n\n", "All the positive things everyone said so far...  \nplus  \n\\+ Google Chromecast + Screen mirroring to TV works even though Home app says\n\"may not be supported\"  \n\\+ Teamviewer Host + Remote Control works perfectly  \n+\n\n", "AWESOME MOBILE. I love this product. I am giving this review used mobile after\n1 week. I bought this product for 6,590/- on Diwali offer along with the cash\nback offer 500. So total my investment (6000/-) only. Now it's available for\n7,590/-. As per price i am very satisfied with this mobile and also i am\ngetting 5\" screen with 2GB ram. The touch and and performance is very good.\nJust camera also good but we need to take photos in the good lighting\ncondition. Front camera also ok. Only minor thing is the charging. The battery\ncapacity (2600 mah) is ok but try to avoid un necessary games, more apps to\nsave the battery. Remaining all is perfect.
