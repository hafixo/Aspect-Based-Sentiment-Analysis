Keep you all posted.  \n  \nI have a put a case to protect the phone as it is delicate in case it falls\ndown. Not sure what to put to protect the screen, if anyone has good\nsuggestion then please share.\n\n", "To be truthful, based on professional reviews, I discarded this tall, narrow\nphone with an awkwardly placed fingerprint scanner and a smaller battery than\nS7 edge, a phone I found inconvenient and sold off in a month. So, it was\niPhone 8, but all the hype evaporated when it was unveiled. So it was back to\nscouting around. I shortlisted OP5, Nokia 8 and S8. As S8 had been in the\nmarket for 2 months I went to a nearby store, handled it and asked for\nfeedback. I was cautious - S8, S8+ and Note 8 looked too good to be true.\nReluctantly I ruled out the larger ones, as the are not handy for those\nwithout jackets most times.  \n  \nStill, it was the last day of an offer, better than Amazon, so I bought S8 for\n49.9k with 12 interest free EMIs and a screen replacement. My preferred color\ngold wasnt available, but I liked the black too, so went ahead.  \n  \nOther reviews have already covered the tech elements, so let me share my user\nexperience of 1 month, that made me fall in love with this phone - easily the\nbest phone I've owned after iPhone4.  \n  \nI use my phone primarily for communication (calls, SMS, WA, SM and utility\napps}, though I do entertain myself on trips, waiting time with videos, high\nend games etc. I havent and dont think I'll enjoy a 2 hr movie on phone. (Must\nadmit I'm watching longer videos more frequently on s8 though)  \n  \nThis phone worked beautifully out of the box - calls, music, videos, GPS\npositioning, mobile network - everything is fast and flawless. No need to\nfiddle with settings, no lagging, heating, hunting for charger all day. I've\nstarted using My galaxy assistant and now Bixby, and I like the look, feel and\nnon intrusive convenience. BTW, I love that its actually easier to hold than\n5.5 in phones, fast charging, battery life, the photo quality and the\nheadphones. On top of that, both colors of the phone look classy. So, I guess\nI'm really saying whats not to like?  \n  \nI hate changing phones and shifting data, which Samsung Switch made short work\nof.  \n  \nIf S8 has any drawback, its the super intrusive google, but thats ubiquitous\n:-(. If only this phone was on IOS, it would be perfection.  \n  \nSome nitpicks that you should know :-  \n(1) hard to find quality tempered glass and cover, which is a must as this\nphone is glass on both sides. The samsung original one is gimmicky and the one\nsalesman was using looked scruffy, so I didnt pay 3000 for it, but bought a\nexpensive 3rd party flip cover (picture enclosed) Not ideal but it doesnt look\nhideous.  \n(2) It comes with a small USB-C to micro-USB adapter, but I just bought an\nextra cable for office, and its all good. Thankfully, Samsung retained the 3.5\nmm headphone jack.  \n(3) Only a hybrid slot. But thats all new phones and iphone doesnt even have\neither, so this is much better.  \n  \nIf Samsung folks are listening, please - SIM cards and memory cards are NOT\ninterchangeable, they do different things, so please be a trendbreaker and\nbring back a separate memory card on S8S oops S9.  \n  \nHope this helped you decide. Good luck with your decision.\n\n", "The design is pretty good and stylish.\n\n", "When i saw it for the 1st time, fell in love with it and made my mind that\nthis is the one i was looking after using HTC One M8 for 3 long years. If want\nsomething different then this will impress you badly.  \nSo finally made the purchase and got it for 40k bucks as my wife is working\nwith samsung so got some employees discount.  \nAfter using for couple of weeks this phone is fast (no lag at all) , easily\nholdable, and midnight black is just beautiful.  \nCamera is aweaome, screen is one of the most refined, speaker is\naverage(compared with HTC m8) , overall built is great.  \n  \nThree cheers for Samsung !!  \nThanks :)\n\n", "The best android out here by samsung ,first of all the design is eye catchy\nand surely makes you go head over your heels , many companies are making bezel\nless displays but samsung has nailed it ,the screen feels like liquid and\nmesmerizes you with WQHD display , the camera is top notch and is a treat to\nclick pictures , the phone works like godspeed and isnt sloppy at all .

The phone is revolutionary and it has stunned the\ncompetitors, no doubt about that. Iphone had to release iPhone X just to stay\nin competition. This time Samsung has played its part very well.  \n  \nI love the phone as I switched from iPhone. Android gives you more liberty. I\nwas able to transfer my contact, photos etc. from iPhone without any hassle,\nsmooth transfer.  \nProcessing, Battery life and charging are good to amazing.  \nDisplay is just beyond anything available. Compare it with IPhone.  \nWater resistant phone.  \n  \nThere are few improvements which can be done:-  \n1\\. Speakers can be made better.  \n2\\.

Holding and using it in one hand is very comfortable.\nDisplay, battery backup and other basics are all up to what you expect from\nthe flagship S series. Knowing that it is the gadget of choice for most tech\nYouTubers and bloggers also helps. The Orchid grey colour I own is the best\nfollowed by black and then blue. Not using any cover or screen guard but\nthinking of ordering a two piece cover given its fragility. The Gorilla glass\nisn't invincible since I have caught minor scratches already and my friend\neven broke it on the edge by dropping it once. Free screen replacements should\ncome handy, though I'm wary of replaced screens after a pathetic experience\nwith Mi. Note 8 is way too large and expensive for me to be comfortable with.\nIphone X would've been a good choice had it been launched when I bought this.  \nOf all the things, the only gripe is the very average 4gb ram. Regardless of\nwhether it'll come in use or not, its premium price tag begs at least 6gb of\nram to keep up a fair game. In fact, I had my Gallery force close quite some\ntime and apps getting stuck in between too. All that could've been saved by\nupgrading the ram.\n\n", "Hello, friends if you want to buy good built quality and sexy phone then\nSamsung Galaxy S8 perfect for you. If you want to know the sound quality of\nthis phone so for me, it is very good, Because It provides very sharp and\nhigh-quality audio. I bought this phone with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal\nmemory. You can store the large amount of data like movies, videos and also\naudios without inserting any SD card but can insert up to 256 GB SD card. S8\nhas Quad HD+ Display made with SUPER AMOLED glass which I love and It\nprotected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Its display size is 5.8 inch. It also\nhas Exynos 8895 Octa Chipset and 12 MP primary camera and 8 MP front camera.\nThis phone comes with Android 7.0 Nougat software version. Because It's huge\nand giant display I like to see high-quality movies and it's feeling amazing.\nIf I talk about the camera so the camera is very good both rear and front.\nThis phone comes with 3500 MAH Li-ion battery so you can say for this giant\ndisplay this battery is not good. But after my usage battery performance is so\nmuch good. The lightweight and beautifully slim design make this phone very\nunique and stylish compared to other phones available on the market. But I\ndon't like one thing of this phone that it's fingerprint sensor placement. But\nsensor quality is good and It has Iris Scanner which I don't use in my regular\nusage. If I talk about service and support so I didn't face any problem with\nthis phone.
