A Value for money. Best pendrive at this cost.  \n2\\. Performance is good- as expected within this rate.  \n3\\. A Trusted & Safe storage device for files by Sandisk- there is minimum\nchance of device malfunction and losing your data.  \n4\\. I have been using this for more than 3 years and its still giving Good\nperformance. So, its very Long-lasting.  \n5\\. Delivery by Amazon was very good- delivered on-time and very well packed.  \n  \nCons:  \n1\\. Slow data transfer speed- 25 mbps export & 4 mbps import ( it's bit low,\nbut OK within this budget)  \n  \nSandisk is one of the most Trusted & Popular companies for storage devices in\nthe world. This product by them is also Good. I was fully satisfied with this\npendrive at this low price. You can undoubtedly go for this device within this\nBudget.  \nIf you like this review please give a Helpful vote...it helps.\n\n", "THE GOOD: Reliable brand, acceptable read speeds averaging at 32MB/s\n(considering it's USB2), stability check passes with no errors (see attached\nscreenshot), have another 8GB cruzerblade that's been used for like 2 whole\nyears and it still performs as new- hope this will turn out to be as durable.  \n  \nTHE BAD: Slow write speed. The device writes at 4 to 6 MB/s maximum (using a\nWindows 10 laptop with i7 5500U CPU, Nvidia GTX 940M GPU, and 16GB RAM, with\nthe drive plugged in a USB 3 port). The drive tends to heat up during\noperation which my older cruzerblade doesn't. The older 8GB cruzerblade stays\ncool even when used constantly for moving data (hours at a time), but this new\ndrive heats up within 10 minutes of ANY read/write operation using the same\npair of computers. The good news (I guess) is that I have an HP w220v flash\ndrive and that heats up as well- it's been heating up for like 4 years, and it\nstill works- heat will probably not damage the device (unless it's heating\nlike a stove,, which it isn't).  \n  \nTHE UGLY: The seller called me and asked me to cancel the order, claiming his\nwarehouse has burned down and if he cancels the order on his own he will be\n\"fined\" by Amazon for not fulfilling his commitment. This is very weird- I've\nbeen shopping online for years and no seller has ever called me up. I called\nAmazon to check, Amazon customer care asked me not to cancel the order. I did\nnot cancel and the product was eventually delivered (before promised date).\nThis was an unique incident, and the chances of this repeating with your order\nis infinitesimally small.  \n  \nUSABLE CAPACITY: 14.5 GB  \n  \nBOTTOM LINE: At this price, you cannot lose. Even if it goes bad, SanDisk is a\ngenuine brand and it comes with a 5 years warranty- you can always call up\nSanDisk and request assistance. Go for it.\n\n", "The speed is amazing and best in this class.  \n#Best in Price  \n#Best in Budget  \n#Compatible to all\n\n", "16Gb pen drive and I got it for 250 bucks during the Great India Sale.

This is not a bad or good thing for me personally its a\nbit of a nuisance to have to pull it with force  \n4\\. the only CON i found was heating - It heats up regardless of the size of\ndata transfer.
