Seagate back up software sometimes cannot detect the hdd, and back up\nnever completes, getting stuck at certain percentage.  \n3\\. heats a lot during copying files.  \nThen I decided to run the 'seatools' program, which is a harddrive test\nprogram by Seagate. After running the test, my hdd failed the Short Drive Self\nTest. Thanks to Amazon return service, I returned the item and bought a WD my\npassport ultra. Which is working fine as of now.  \nNow here are few things to remember-  \n1\\. Seagate after sale service is not very good, WD offers pick up service,\nbut Seagate wants you to send the product to the service centre, WD replaces\nthe product within warranty, but Seagate repairs the defective product, which\nrequires more time.  \n2\\. Seagate recently bought Samsung's hdd division, therefore in most cases\nthere is a Samsung hdd inside a Seagate hdd casing. That means you are\nactually buying a Samsung harddrive. (you can check in YouTube).  \n3\\. I advice all of you to run the seatools test as soon as you get the\nHarddisk, if it fails any of the tests, then return the hdd.  \n4.two stars only for the looks, it has better looking than WD my passport.\n\n", "About Amazon (for 2nd purchase of HDD) :  \nPROS-  \n# Appreciate quick delivery (3rd day as promised) by Amazon.  \n# This is my 2nd HDD as I had return one before due to confusion in Part\nnumber mentioned on box and actual HDD (will explain you below).  \n# The refund by Amazon was very quick and I appreciate Amazon for their quick\nresponse without any hesitation. Amount was refunded in my account on the 3rd\nday of returning the Old HDD (which I ordered 1st time...a month before in\nJan'15). This is one of the reason I dare to order 2nd HDD again from Amazon.  \n# Amazon Customer care are very assistive.  \n  \nCONS-  \n# Packaging Quality has to be improved as I found the HDD box was wrapped in\nsimple hard board without any air cushions. 1 rating less only for this (or\nelse it stands for 5 stars)  \n  \nAbout Product:-  \n  \nPROS:  \n# A nice very light weight HDD i ever purchased (Blue Color).  \n# Used hardly yet, but found no heating after 45min of use. So I uess Seagate\nkeeps the quality standard.  \n# Make no noise and silent compare to one I have old 500GB of HDD that I\nbought 4 yrs before and is working fantastic.  \n  \nCONS:  \n# This is my 2nd HDD I ordered from Amazon within difference of a month. Blame\nto the confusion/difference of Part number printed on the HDD box and on\nactual HDD (though serial number was same). I returned it thinking this could\nbe some problem and I may get into trouble in case of warranty (though Seagate\nwebsite was showing the warranty of 3yrs based on part and serial number as on\nbox)  \n# Found the same for second ordered HDD also (Though serial number of HDD is\nsame, Part number mentioned on the Box and Actual HDD was different).  \n# I called Seagate to know this and they confirmed that they consider the\nwarranty based on serial number only and I need not to worry about part\nnumber.  \n# Hats Off to Seagate Customer care, that they even helped me to recover 3\nmonths of my warranty period as the product was shipped to Distributor 3\nmonths ago and I got it now in Feb'15.  \n  \nFinal Verdict :  \n# Appreciate Seagate's and Amazon's service quality.  \n# For Product, as of now looks cool without any issues, will repost in case of\nany issues that can help you.\n\n", "Seagate's Backup Plus = you may use the Seagate's backup software to\nautomatically backup your computer data to this hard drive on schedule basis.  \nSlim = it really is a slim ext. hard drive.  \n  \nApart from being a decent, slim, backup, external HDD, there are a few other\nthings that are worthy of mentioning about the device. It operates on your\nComputer's USB power with the help of a supplied, short USB 3.0 cable\n(backwards compatible); no other external power source needed. Despite\nextended periods of data transfer between a computer and the hard drive, the\nHDD wasn't very hot.  \n  \nThe 3 years limited warranty by Seagate is kind of a life saver, should the\ndevice malfunction. How effective their support / service is, only the ones\nwho contact them will know.  \n  \nData transfer rates are only bottlenecked by your computer's USB port /\ncontroller. This is a USB 3.0 device, and connecting it to one such port is\nwhat gives you the best performance; whatever it is capable of.  \n  \nUnfortunately, I haven't run a benchmark test on it to analyze its data\ntransfer speeds.

I have written about the same to Seagate support\nand I'm waiting for their response.

This new arrival\nBackup Plus Slim is awesome, because size of the drives are very compact. so\nyou can easily carry your drives with you anywhere. So I think it is superb,\nIf you want to buy any external hard drives than please use Seagate drives.  \n  \nOther features like,  \n  \nHardware Platform- You can use this drives with your pc and mac also. The\nawesome thing of this drive is it will not need any software on your pc and\nmac for backup and stuff. so this thing i like most about it. So you can\ndirectly connect your hard drive through usb cable to pc or mac.  \n  \nHardware Interface- SuperSpeed USB 3.0 & USB 2.0 and they provide the 18 inch\nUSB cable.  \n  \nIf you are mac user than you can easily download the NTFS software from\nseagate website.  \n  \nThey also provide 200GB Cloud Storage with OneDrive for 2 years.  \n  \nWeight of this hard drive is around 222gm. So very light weight and more\nefficient.  \n  \nYou will also get 3 year manufacturer warranty from Seagate.  \n  \nThey also provide Seagate Mobile Backup. Requirements: iOS 7 or higher android\n2.3 or higher.  \n  \nPC Requirements: Mac OS X 10.7 or higher, Windows 7 or higher operating system  \n  \nSo. overall very good product.

But it was working if you adjust a\nbit(which shouldn't be the case). After another 2-3 months it was very hard to\nget the device detect in my laptop or computer (may be the wire has something\nfault). And today morning just now it is not detecting at all which made me to\nreview the product. I've already tried several times to connect and it took my\nalmost 1 hour, yet not detecting the device. Now i don't know what to do.  \n  \nI can buy another connector to connect the HDD but the problem is i don't know\nexactly where is the problem (HDD port or the connector). Again if i am\nspending my 4.5k on a HDD (i got for this price) then i should get a connector\nwhich should work fine atleast 2-3 years (i still think problem is with the\nconnector but i am not sure). It seems that the connector's pin is a bit\nsmaller than port of the HDD since it does not fit at all.

I also used it with OTG Cable with my\nsmartphone and it WORKED!  \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \n\\---] As far as READING and WRITING speed goes, it copied my 1.2 GB folder in\naround 25 seconds.

Although I only opted for regular delivery, I received it within 2\ndays, and that too on a Sunday. Another example of Amazon's prompt and\nefficient delivery service. I have been using it for less than a week, so I\ncannot comment on how it will turn out in the long term. As of now:  \nPros: 1. Looks classy, operates quietly, and requires no additional batteries\nor power source. Just plug it into the laptop and it's good to go.  \n3\\. It is light and does not heat up much even if plugged in for a long time.  \n4\\. People have been complaining about the difficulty in registering the\nwarranty. But I had no problem with the registration at the Seagate site.\nMoreover, I got a full 3-year warranty.  \n5\\. I have backed up 2 laptops on this hard disk, without any glitches. The\nwhole process is easy, the backed up material is kept in separate folders for\nthe two laptops and is easily accessible. There are many options to choose\nfrom (i.e. automatic backup at regular intervals, manual backup, etc.) Your\nphone may also be backed up, but I haven't done so as yet, so cannot comment\non it.  \n6\\. If you're still unsure of what to do, there are several excellent\ntutorials on You Tube that are clear and lucid and will guide you through the\nprocess.  \nCons:  \n1\\. The first-time backup takes hours. You can still continue to work on your\nmachine but it could slow down till the backup is over.  \n2\\. The subsequent backup took me just about 15 minutes for my husband's\nlaptop. For mine, where I have more data, the second time around it took 1\nhour 15 minutes. (The time taken was more than twice that the first time. This\ndifference occurs, I presume, because it's an incremental backup. i.e., what\nyou have already backed up remains on the external hard disk, and each time\naround, only new files or files that have been changed in some way are backed\nup.) Still, there's not that much additional data on my machine, between\nbackups. so this seems like a lot of time for that.\n\n", "HELLO GUYS & DOSTO  \n= = = = = =  \nBEFORE STARTING OFF THE REVIEW I WANNA MENTION THAT THE PRODUCT SEAGATE ULTRA\nSIM WAS PROVIDED BY THE AMAZON SELLER AND AFTER USING IT FOR 3 WEEK\u2019S AND I AM\nHERE TO GIVE A DETAILED REVIEW OF IT.  \n  \nSEAGATE IS IN THIS FIELD FOR MANY YEARS AND YES THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST\nEXTERNAL DRIVE COMPAINES MANUFACTURERS AVAILABLE.  \n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  \nSO STARTING WITH THE REVIEW  \n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  \n  \nWHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX  \n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  \nSEAGATE ULTRA SLIM ITSELF  \nUSB TO HARD DRIVE DATA CABLE.  \nDOCUMENTATION.  \n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  \n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  \nATTRACTIVE FEATURES AND STUFFS  \n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  \nULTRA SLIM  \nGOOD BUILD QUALITY  \nPLUG AND PLAY. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  \nMY OPINION  \nThe external drive is compatible with  \nWindows XP, 7, 8, 10.  \nOS X 10.6.8 OR higher  \nANDROID 2.3 OR higher  \niOS 6 OR higher  \none thing that I found missing was that the carry case was not there and they\nshould have provide it so that the the customers are fully satisfied regarding\nthis but that\u2019s fine the look and feel of this hard drive is just the best I\nwould say the slimmest hard drive I ever seen .  \nVery durable.  \n  \n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n- -  \nCONCLUSION  \nBuy it if you want sleek design and performance it just that good  \n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  \n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  \nIf find it help full please click the helpful button.  \nThank You.\n\n", "It is a good product. Very light and easy to handle. But, I strangely received\na product with three different manufacturing date. The outer box of the\nproduct also looked quiet old and faded. The PN number printed on the box\nmentioned manufacturing date as August 2016 . Then there were several retailer\nstickers on the product. One of the stickers mentioned November 2017 as\nmanufacturing date. Another mentioned December 2017. The serial number when\nchecked online says it is guaranteed till 2025.

It took me just 5 mins to\nregister for my product & warranty.  \n  \nWhat I found it was lacking : In built Encryption or Password protection to\nsave your data from voyeurs. I think such protection is very much inevitable\nin today's time.  \n  \nOverall: 4 Out of 5. Seagate lose 1 star for not providing Encryption. And\nalso for not providing Case/Pouch for product as delicate as this & I had to\nshell out another 300-400 bucks for the same.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 22 March 2018", "on 25 January 2018", "on 29 January 2018", "on 12 July 2016", "on 19 March 2018", "on 11 June 2017", "on 14 March 2018", "on 15 July 2017", "on 21 February 2018", "on 10 March 2016"], "reviewer": ["Amazon Customer", "Nitin mudgal", "#OM", "Kalyanam harish Kumar", "Ajay Kajale", "Amazon Customer", "Mandik Goyal", "Anurag", "Amazon", "Satvik Patel"]},
