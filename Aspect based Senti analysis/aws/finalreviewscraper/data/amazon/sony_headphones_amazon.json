Sound quality is average but OK for\nheadphone in this range. These lasted around 6 months. After around 2 months\nthe gold plating on connectors faded away. After around 6 months the\nconnections on the headphone jack connections became loose and sounds became\nintermittent and I had to open and see what went wrong. That is when I noticed\nquality of build and material used inside.  \n  \nOpinion after use for 6+ months -  \n1\\. Average build quality  \n2\\. Not sure if it is original Sony. The quality of soldering and connectors\nindicate cheap quality parts used and poor assembly quality which is not as\nper Sony or any good branded product.  \n3\\. See pictures of connectors and original soldering on joints which is\nsubstandard.  \n  \nOK if you get it in a sale around Rs 500 and if you can do minor repairs in\ncase it fails for you.\n\n", "I used this product around 1 month nice head phone  \nDesign, specifications and comfort  \nThe Sony MDR-ZX110 looks fancy and expensive from a distance, with a\ncombination of matte and gloss finishes on the body that comes across as more\npremium than anything else we've seen at this price. However, up close it\nfeels strictly budget. The plastic is flimsy and bendy, and does not look or\nfeel like it can take too much abuse, so careful handling is advised.  \n  \nThis headset has a rather unique folding mechanism that allows the ear cups to\ntwist inwards, into the headband. This makes the MDR-ZX110 a bit easier to\nstore when not in use. Apart from this, the Sony MDR-ZX110 has 30mm dynamic\ndrivers, with a frequency response range of 12-22,000Hz, 24Ohms impedance and\na sensitivity rating of 98dB. The MDR-ZX110 doesn't have an inline mic or\nremote control, but Sony does sell a nearly identical model, the MDR-ZX110AP\nwhich does, for Rs. 700 more.  \n  \nThe ear cups have very slight padding, which is enough for an acceptably\ncomfortable on-ear fit. The headband has no cushioning, but is designed well\nand feels secure and comfortable in place. The MDR-ZX110 also has a thick,\ntough cable that looks like it can take a fair bit of strain. Past the\nY-splitter, the 1.2m cable splits into two separate and somewhat flat cables\nthat aren't quite as sturdy as the lower half. The design and thickness makes\nthe cable somewhat tangle resistant, and extremely resistant to cable noise.\nOn the whole, apart from the flimsiness, we're happy with how the Sony MDR-\nZX110 looks and feels.  \n  \nPerformance  \nWith the Sony MDR-ZX110 being an entry-level on-ear headset, we did most of\nour testing using an Android smartphone. We also tried it with our Fiio X1\nhigh-resolution audio player and a Windows laptop. Focus tracks for the review\nwere BT's Somnambulist, Skrillex and Diplo's To U, and Passenger's Circles.  \n  \nStarting with the bass-heavy Somnambulist, we found that the Sony MDR-ZX110\nhad a meaty sound, with lots of emphasis on low-end attack. The bass can\noccasionally be overpowering, but is usually controlled thanks to the not-so-\ntight fit. The sonic signature has been tuned toward promoting the lows, and\nthis makes for a very warm sound. This also tends to show a bit in the lower-\nmid ranges, but there is a clear sensitivity drop towards the upper end of the\nfrequency range.Next, we cued up To U, which despite being a dubstep track,\nhas plenty to offer in terms of the mid-range and detail. While the Sony\nheadset is impressive in low-end detail, it seems to trail off going up the\nrange. The result is a sound that isn't quite as open and detailed as we'd\nlike, even at this price. Other products such as the Sennheiser HD180 offer\nbetter levels of detail at this price, so the MDR-ZX110 isn't something we'd\nrecommend if you're looking for sonic clarity.  \n  \nFinally, with Circles, we kept our ears open for imaging and soundstaging.\nWhile the Sony offers a full and aggressive presentation in the sound, it\nfalls a bit short in terms of openness and width. The sonic stage feels narrow\nand specific, rather than properly spread out. However, the MDR-ZX110\ncertainly does its bit to make your music immersive and entertaining,\nespecially if you like your headphones bassy and aggressive.  \n  \ncarry forward the typical aesthetic that makes Sony a popular headphone\noption, but it falls a bit short in terms of build quality. It feels cheap and\nwe were always worried about damage during our time with the review unit.\nHowever, it offers an immersive, full sound that excels in its handling of\nbass. Detail and clarity suffer a bit, but bass-heads will not find too much\nto complain about at this price. If you're looking for a pair of on-ears with\nserious attack and drive at under Rs. 600 the Sony MDR-ZX110A should be on\nyour wish list.\n\n", "Well sony is all about music as we all know and the sony mdr zx 110a fulfill\nthis requirement among music at this price specially, if u are looking for\ngood or normal bass then you all go for it but not for heavy bass then g o for\njbl t series. But I am satisfied with this range of headphone that sony\noffers(\u20b9610).vocal are so much clear or I can say crystal clear that you can\nhear every lines clearly even if it English or Hindi both.Now coming to the\nwire it is tough can't be get easily damaged if you keep safely. So all I want\nto say don't compare to \u20b91500 headphones like jbl,or sony. l have used jbl\ntempo(\u20b91500) it was awesome at bass and vocals but it doesn't mean that this\nsony headphone is bad no not at all, go for it friends as it is at low price\nat present and at this price you will be happy to get this, I love the\nheadphone and I hope you will love it too.Thank you\ud83d\ude03\n\n", "I am using this product for 4 months.  \nThere are lot of PROS ,in this price range the product is really good and the\naudio output is decent .  \nIts easy to fold and carry .  \nIts very light weight and even after listening to music for lot of hours you\nwon't feel any discomfort.  \nNow the CONS : Its made up of cheap plastic.  \nWhile listening to music you can still hear the outside sound and the thin\ncovering over the sponges will tear easily.  \nAccidently if you place any heavy object above that , like your laptop and i\nam sorry your headset will broke.  \nIf you found this review helpful please mark it as HELPFUL .\n\n", "I'm a sound Engineer of good experience so i would like to share a good\nreview.  \nValue for money.  \nPros.  \nLight weight.  \nSound quality is not bad. Lack of tight punch but does its job good.  \nThe Brand Sony.  \nGold plated 3.5mm jack.  \nTangle free cables.  \n  \nCons.  \nNot For long time listening.  \nEar cups are not so durable and will get dirty soon after a period of rough\nusage.  \nSound quality is not that great. For sure a muddy Mid is a drawback.  \nNot for BASS lovers definitely.  \nShould handle with care without dropping it.  \n  \nVerdict.  \nFor this price point its a good buy, It should be a secondary headphones if\nyou are a music lover.  \nBut definitively not for audiophile. Watching youtube listening to soundcloud\nthis headphones are worth a try.  \nNOTE : All this review is based on my testing.\n\n", "I ordered Sony MDR-ZX110A. When I received the package outside the box it was\nmentioned Sony MDR-ZX110A but inside I got the old version i.e. Sony MDR-ZX110\nwith an year old manufacturing date and that too defective piece with sound\ncoming only from right side.  \nLooks like a fake product.  \nI have created the return request for this.\n\n", "Usually I'm a critic and I found few points on this product. But before\ncritising this product let me explain the complete and detailed experience\nwith this.(with the pros and cons mixing and comparing)  \nFirst of all. this product has owned it's \"trademark\" style and grabbing\neveryone's attention on it with its \"appeal look\"  \nNext point is. The bass. Yes,the bass is not very pulsive but yeah...it has\ngot some decent bass wch is very much safer than other \"extra bass\" products.\nSo this product is good at providing some bass and at the same time protecting\nour ears.  \nNext comes to the sound. Sound is very decent and loud enough for people who\nloves more sound. But the sound is also likely the same as bass. Bit lower\ncompared to other \"very expensive\" products. As I said this product is giving\na decent sound wch is not much irratative like other expensives!  \nComing to durability, this Device is good at durability and reliability too.(\nNot with miscellaneous cases like forcing to break,etc)  \nThe wire length. Is also a good length. As most of the ppl are worried about\nthe length these days. This product is given with a decent amount of length\nfor traveling.  \nAnd finally the \"justice to money\" . I think this product is scoring full\nmarks on this point. 600/- odd (prices may vary from seller to seller and also\non the offer season, and I found 600/- is the average cost ) I think the\nstyle,the sound,most importantly the company branding and the warranty are\noffering a great justice to this price.  \nSimply.. best opt for the low\" budgeters\" with a high class look! Good luck!\n\n", "I\u2019ve been using these headphones for about 3 months now.  \nI\u2019ve purchased it from Amazon and I got it for INR619.  \nNow the price seems to be bit lower still there is a price difference of\naround 100rs which is a good deal,  \nit is now priced at 539 INR at Amazon. I read reviewers saying they brought it\nunder 500INR.Comparing it with other headphones in and around this price\nrange, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this as the best buy for everyone.  \nBut if you\u2019re looking for some style blended with satisfactory audio quality\nand insist about going for an over the ear headphones,  \nthen this ones for you guys  \n  \nSONY MDR-ZX110 is one of Sony\u2019s most popular over the ear headphones .  \nIts brilliantly priced at a price range where there isn\u2019t much competitors\nthat can  \ncompete with Sony\u2019s brand value and the stylish design of the product.  \nIt has got a stylish and functional folding mechanism that allows the ear cups  \nto twist inwards into the headband, making it travel friendly .  \nIts Made entirely of plastic and the plastic quality feels premium.  \nIt's light and comfortable, which can be used hassle free over long periods.  \n  \nBranding:  \n======  \n  \nWhen it comes to Brand recognition, there is only a handful of audio\nmanufacturers can compete with Sony. It has got a brand name that has been\nbuilt up over the decades of quality products. These headphones prove no less\nin terms of branding, be it in case of the iconic design or be it the minimum\nstandard kept in not sacrificing the audio quality for satisfying budget\nrequirements  \nStyle: This is totally a style iconic product, it has got the iconic Sony\ndesign. It has got a stylish and functional folding mechanism that allows the\near cups to twist inwards into the headband. With the combination of matte and\ngloss finishes on the body, it gives a premium feel right away.  \n  \nComfort  \n======  \nproduct is just a bit tight on ears, as far as long time usage is concerned\nthis headset doesn\u2019t give you quite a comfortable feeling. Anyways its much\nlighter than its competitors. The cushions for the ear cups gives you enough\ncomfort ,but the headband has no cushioning at all ,which was required for the\ncomfortable over-head fit, but it is compensated to an extent by the brilliant\ndesign by Sony. The cable has got adequate thickness and is of 1.2m length\nwith 3.5mm pin which is not gold plated  \n  \nSound Quality : \u201cAdequate\u201d  \n===========  \nBass -7/10  \nTreble -6/10  \nClarity -6.5/10  \nComfort -7/10  \nOverall -6.5/10  \n  \nValue For Money :  \n=============  \nAs far the 600INR price point is considered the product is a worth the money.\nvalue for money proposition is maintained. Sound quality may not be premium,\nbut for this price range you can\u2019t easily find a better over the ear headphone\nwith a this much style and attitude.  \nThis is indeed a very good product. I got it for under \u20b9600 and at that price\npoint I believe that's not money wasted.  \n  \n********  \nPROS:  \n********  \n# BRILLIANT PRICING  \n# Stylish, Comfortable and Functional Design  \n# Bass-driven sound with adequate sound quality  \n# Premium quality and finish of material used  \n# Much lighter than its competitors  \n  \n********  \nCONS:  \n********  \n  \nSONY MDR-ZX110 is one of the highest selling audio products in Amazon for a\nlong time, but it has got its own flaws too.  \n  \n# 3.5mm pin is not gold plated  \n# Prone to breaking if not taken care properly  \n# No cushioning provide for headband  \n# A carrying pouch would\u2019ve helped  \n  \nMY VERDICT:  \n===========  \nThis one is a good budget buy over the ear headphones priced brilliantly at a\nprice range of rs.500-600, where there isn\u2019t much alternatives to go for if\nyou want a stylish product without compromising much on the music quality  \nwill these head phones serve your purpose ?,  \nwell that solely depends on what type of user you are.  \nIf you're someone who is looking for a stylish branded product with which you\ncan express you attitude and at the same time you don\u2019t want to compromise\nmuch on the quality front, then you can surely consider this product.  \nBut if you're all into hardcore music then this one may end up disappointing\nyou.  \n  \nAnyways DO SURF,COMPARE AND DECIDE what\u2019s the best one for you before you\nswipe your card of  \n  \nBe cautious while selecting the seller and make sure that your seller has\nminimum rating and if the Amazon fulfilled badge is there its better to opt\nfor that seller even if the price is a bit higher .Do surf and check for any\nbetter deals available  \nSHOP WISE ,SAVE BUCKS  \nHappy Shopping  \n  \nhope you found this review helpful\n\n", "Hi Guys !!  \n  \nThis review is about the SONY MDR-ZX110A headphones.  \n  \nI am writing this review after two months of usage as on date 25th Oct'16 as I\npurchased the headphones on Amazon during the August sale for Rs 499 only .  \n  \nTo watch the detailed video of the headphone after two months of usage head to\nthe link on youtube: [...]  \n  \nLook and Feel :  \n  \nThe headphone looks great , I have a white one and it feels good in hands,\nwhile it feels more of plastic, this does not come in the way of the feel\nwhile on ears.

Using a brand name that has been carefully\nbuilt up over the decades, Sony is one of a handful of companies in India that\ncan sell headphones by the thousand. This is thanks to a huge portfolio\nspanning various price ranges, from as little as Rs. 590, going up to Rs.\n41,990.  \nOne of Sony's most popular on-ear models is also one of its cheapest: the Rs.\n990 MDR-ZX110. Boasting Sony's iconic design, the ZX110 is a budget champion\nand one of the best selling personal audio products in India. Can Sony deliver\nat such a low budget? We find out in our review.  \n  \nsony_mdr_zx110_earcup_ndtv.jpg  \nDesign, specifications and comfort  \nThe Sony MDR-ZX110 looks fancy and expensive from a distance, with a\ncombination of matte and gloss finishes on the body that comes across as more\npremium than anything else we've seen at this price.

Now comparing it with them. Moto has a\ngood bass but vocals are not crisp and Treble is not so smooth. While Philips\nis a kind of Balanced one. Now MDR zx110A is quiet a complete package. It has\na Punchy Bass, Incredible High and Dipping Low. Vocals are crystal clear. I've\nhave tested all most of the Genre Like Metal core, EDM, Progressive, Classic\nand some others. Leaving EDM all the Genre were extremely good in Sony. While\nMoto triumph the EDM, thanks to the 36mm Driver. But Sony is best n most of\nthe scenario.Now about the build quality, Both of them are made from plastic.\nMoto looks a bit fragile, as the top bar is very thin. And it has only one\nwire, so if the headphone strap breaks, then wire will be damaged. While for\nSony they know how to make Cheap and Durable product. Padding are ambient in\nboth of them, but sony is a bit more comfortable, as the shape of the ear cup\nis circular and not oval like moto.  \nAs its Sony After Sales Service will not be a problem, as their service\ncenters are omnipresent. Nothing left to comment. Just if you want a Headphone\nin good Budget which sounds great, and not giving boasting about Bass. Then go\nfor Sony. Otherwise if you want a Headphone with High Bass and which has MIC\nthen Moto is go to choice.  \nThats all Folks. If you like my review dont forget to hit that LIKE button,\nand show support.\n\n", "Just bang for the buck... U will not get better headphones than this at this\nprice point. I have used other headphones like Phillips dj shl3000 & JBL\nheadphone of this price segment but I was most impressed with this.  \nBass is great, voice and treble are sometimes overshadowed by bass.  \nSo I will recommend to buy this if you are in tight budget and loves rock,\nEDM, rap, metal songs. Otherwise I might be disappointed.  \nAlso the wires are long enough to be used conveniently.\n\n", "HEY HELLO GUYS...  \nI WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE : Sony MDR-ZX110A On-\nEar Stereo Headphones  \n  \n\ud83e\udd14\u200b MY OPINION :  \n  \n1)Good Points :  \nSony knows that how to made a good headphones...  \nThey made really nice headphones.  \nBuilt quality of these headphone is good according to its price.  \nIt is good to carry because of its \"Swivel folding design\".  \nSound quality is really great & it gives good quality of sound.  \nPrice is also low compare to the other headphones.  \nIt's really nice & perfect budget headphone.  \n  \n2)Bad Points :  \nThere are not much bad points in these headphone but, the thing that\ndisappoint me is, it is not scratch proof.  \nscratches is the big issue for me & I think for other users also...OR they\nalso don't provide any kind of case for the headphone.  \n  \n3)Rating : 4.6/5  \nMY OPINION IS THAT,  \nMUST BUY IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE HEADPHONE FOR THE DAILY USE OR IF LOOKING\nBUDGET BEST HEADPHONE.  \nI ALSO HAVE ONE HEADPHONE FROM THE \"MDR\" SERIES,  \n& THEY ARE REALLY GREAT ...  \nSO MY OPINION FOR YOU GUYS : \"JUST BUY IT\"  \n  \n\ud83d\udcb3 ABOUT PRODUCT :  \n1\\.

Using a brand name that has been carefully\nbuilt up over the decades, Sony is one of a handful of companies in India that\ncan sell headphones by the thousand. This is thanks to a huge portfolio\nspanning various price ranges, from as little as Rs. 590, going up to Rs.\n41,990.  \nOne of Sony's most popular on-ear models is also one of its cheapest: the Rs.\n990 MDR-ZX110. Boasting Sony's iconic design, the ZX110 is a budget champion\nand one of the best selling personal audio products in India. Can Sony deliver\nat such a low budget? We find out in our review.  \nsony_mdr_zx110_earcup_ndtv.jpg  \nDesign, specifications and comfort  \nThe Sony MDR-ZX110 looks fancy and expensive from a distance, with a\ncombination of matte and gloss finishes on the body that comes across as more\npremium than anything else we've seen at this price. However, up close it\nfeels strictly budget. The plastic is flimsy and bendy, and does not look or\nfeel like it can take too much abuse, so careful handling is advised.  \nThis headset has a rather unique folding mechanism that allows the ear cups to\ntwist inwards, into the headband. This makes the MDR-ZX110 a bit easier to\nstore when not in use. Apart from this, the Sony MDR-ZX110 has 30mm dynamic\ndrivers, with a frequency response range of 12-22,000Hz, 24Ohms impedance and\na sensitivity rating of 98dB. The MDR-ZX110 doesn't have an inline mic or\nremote control, but Sony does sell a nearly identical model, the MDR-ZX110AP\nwhich does, for Rs. 700 more.  \nThe ear cups have very slight padding, which is enough for an acceptably\ncomfortable on-ear fit. The headband has no cushioning, but is designed well\nand feels secure and comfortable in place. The MDR-ZX110 also has a thick,\ntough cable that looks like it can take a fair bit of strain. Past the\nY-splitter, the 1.2m cable splits into two separate and somewhat flat cables\nthat aren't quite as sturdy as the lower half. The design and thickness makes\nthe cable somewhat tangle resistant, and extremely resistant to cable noise.\nOn the whole, apart from the flimsiness, we're happy with how the Sony MDR-\nZX110 looks and feels.  \nsony_mdr_zx110_hinge_ndtv.jpg  \nPerformance  \nWith the Sony MDR-ZX110 being an entry-level on-ear headset, we did most of\nour testing using an Android smartphone. We also tried it with our Fiio X1\nhigh-resolution audio player and a Windows laptop. Focus tracks for the review\nwere BT's Somnambulist, Skrillex and Diplo's To U, and Passenger's Circles.  \nStarting with the bass-heavy Somnambulist, we found that the Sony MDR-ZX110\nhad a meaty sound, with lots of emphasis on low-end attack. The bass can\noccasionally be overpowering, but is usually controlled thanks to the not-so-\ntight fit. The sonic signature has been tuned toward promoting the lows, and\nthis makes for a very warm sound. This also tends to show a bit in the lower-\nmid ranges, but there is a clear sensitivity drop towards the upper end of the\nfrequency range.  \nsony_mdr_zx110_padding_ndtv.jpg  \nNext, we cued up To U, which despite being a dubstep track, has plenty to\noffer in terms of the mid-range and detail. While the Sony headset is\nimpressive in low-end detail, it seems to trail off going up the range. The\nresult is a sound that isn't quite as open and detailed as we'd like, even at\nthis price. Other products such as the Sennheiser HD180 offer better levels of\ndetail at this price, so the MDR-ZX110 isn't something we'd recommend if\nyou're looking for sonic clarity.  \nFinally, with Circles, we kept our ears open for imaging and soundstaging.\nWhile the Sony offers a full and aggressive presentation in the sound, it\nfalls a bit short in terms of openness and width. The sonic stage feels narrow\nand specific, rather than properly spread out. However, the MDR-ZX110\ncertainly does its bit to make your music immersive and entertaining,\nespecially if you like your headphones bassy and aggressive.  \nsony_mdr_zx110_cable_ndtv.jpg  \nVerdict  \nThe Sony MDR-ZX110 might look good and carry forward the typical aesthetic\nthat makes Sony a popular headphone option, but it falls a bit short in terms\nof build quality. It feels cheap and we were always worried about damage\nduring our time with the review unit. However, it offers an immersive, full\nsound that excels in its handling of bass. Detail and clarity suffer a bit,\nbut bass-heads will not find too much to complain about at this price. If\nyou're looking for a pair of on-ears with serious attack and drive at under\nRs. 1,000, the Sony MDR-ZX110 should be on your wish list.  \nPrice (MRP): Rs. 990  \nPros  \nComfortable on-ear design  \nGood low-end response  \nSturdy cable  \nFull, exciting sound  \nCons  \nFlimsy build  \nWeak mids and highs  \nRatings (Out of 5)  \nDesign: 3.5  \nPerformance: 3.5  \nValue for money: 4  \nOverall: 3.5\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 24 January 2017", "on 3 February 2018", "on 7 December 2017", "on 30 June 2017", "on 23 November 2017", "on 17 September 2017", "on 7 January 2018", "on 10 December 2016", "on 21 February 2018", "on 14 November 2016"], "reviewer": ["ruchika(niku)", "Debangana G.", "Somanth Geddam", "ASHISH PANDEY\u2714", "Top 5 Originals", "Prabir Sur", "Kanhaiya", "THE AK", "sanoshin", "Harshit Bhatia"]},

At this price range, the\nsound quality it offers is exceptional. The trebles and the bass are well\nbalanced. You can hear the rhythm of every vocals and instruments. I read some\nreviews that bass is not good and sound creaks sometimes. Well guys, What more\nyou want from a \u20b9600 headphone? For those who want more bass they can use a\ngood equalizer from playstore and enjoy bass boosted sound.And regarding the\ncreaking sound there may be several reasons three of them are,  \n1) The product you received my be a damaged one. (I think you'd know what to\ndo next! Simply replace it!)  \n2) The audio jack of the device you're using may be damaged. (Change device or\nuse different one!)  \n3) The sound quality of song is terrible. (Now, you can't listen a 90kbps song\nand complain it's creaking! I recommend to use 190/250 or 360kbps at best!)  \n  \nAnd many people also complain that the sound coming from headphones is not\nloud. Regarding this I would say that the loudness of the sound depends on the\ndriver of device you're using. Simply put PCs have powerful sound card and\nMobiles ain't much powerful. So that's obvious that on pc it would sound\nlouder. (In mobiles too loudness of sound varies from phone to phone)  \n  \nNow comes the build quality.

At this price range, the\nsound quality it offers is exceptional. The trebles and the bass are well\nbalanced. You can hear the rhythm of every vocals and instruments. I read some\nreviews that bass is not good and sound creaks sometimes. Well guys, What more\nyou want from a \u20b9600 headphone? For those who want more bass they can use a\ngood equalizer from playstore and enjoy bass boosted sound.And regarding the\ncreaking sound there may be several reasons three of them are,  \n1) The product you received my be a damaged one. (I think you'd know what to\ndo next! Simply replace it!)  \n2) The audio jack of the device you're using may be damaged. (Change device or\nuse different one!)  \n3) The sound quality of song is terrible. (Now, you can't listen a 90kbps song\nand complain it's creaking! I recommend to use 190/250 or 360kbps at best!)  \n  \nAnd many people also complain that the sound coming from headphones is not\nloud. Regarding this I would say that the loudness of the sound depends on the\ndriver of device you're using. Simply put PCs have powerful sound card and\nMobiles ain't much powerful. So that's obvious that on pc it would sound\nlouder. (In mobiles too loudness of sound varies from phone to phone)  \n  \nNow comes the build quality. The build quality of these headphones is also\ngood, but it would have been better. Even tough with this build it should last\nfor at least 1 to 1.5 years.

You pay 600 for this pair of phones and expect\nthem to work like some professional audio device that costs 25,000!!! (yes, I\nam talking about some Bose headphones out there). C'mon guys!!! This isn't\nfair. This is entry-level budget headphones and yes, these the drivers don't\ndisappoint. In fact at this price range, it is a steal and complete value for\nmoney. Sure, the quality of the material itself is a little delicate and\nthat's understood considering the price. I am only commenting here because I\nhave read quite a lot of bad reviews here which are misleading the potential\nbuyers. I won't go into the review of the headphones itself as there are\nplenty here. I am more than happy with it. I recently bought a pair of Philips\nPhilips SHP1900/97 Over-Ear Stereo Headphone (Black)\u00a0and I returned it at\nonce, since it was very uncomfortable for long use, but bought it again as the\nlength of the wire was longer and it was enough for my needs (meaning I can\nnow sit a little farther from my Desktop PC and watch a movie). Now, this Sony\npair is better than that. Bass and Treble are well balanced. Voice is clear.\nL-shaped jack. White looks awesome for my white Asus notebook. More than\nanything, they are very comfortable. Honestly, I just bought this for my\nnotebook only. For the desktop I use Philips, and for my phone I use Amazon\nearbuds.  \nSure, these aren't the best the money can buy, but if you are like, me hard-\nstrapped for cash, (most of my budget goes for buying literature classics from\nAmazon) then buy this. Even if it comes for a year (yes, this has a 1-year\nwarranty) it is worth the penny (I meant rupee)!\n\n", "***Writing this review after using these headphones for a month****  \n  \nJust go and search for a headphone on any of the websites and you would\nencounter this as one among the top recommended ones with lesser cost(I got it\nfor Rs.499.00). If you talk about the cost of the product this is much lesser\nthan few earphones like Sennhieser cx 180 and other. This shows the importance\ngiven by all the customers in purchasing this.  \n  \nConsidering the above, I could confirm this as a hot cake in headphones\nsection. Now, let me give you the pros and cons in a clear way.  \n  \nSound quality: Of course this is the most important reason why we go for\nheadphones over earphones. At the price, this headphones actually does its job\nreally well. I have been using this for last 1 month and I didn't find any\nproblem with this.  \n  \nFor Normal Listeners: This sounds like a God-sent (Majorly taking budget into\nconsideration).  \nFor Experienced Listeners:Can't explain but FEEL the bass at this cheaper\nprice.  \nFor Audiophiles: Pay more and go for better one like Sennheiser HD 202.  \n  \nDesign: This has an amazing design where you could even fold it easily. Never\nfeel so heavy and portable too with huge comfort. This weights around 110\ngrams which is very easy to carry.  \n  \nOn ear experience: This is the first headphone where I felt a great comfort\neven after using it for hours.  \n  \nHere are the top points of both pros and cons.  \nPros:  \n1\\. Less weight- Easy to carry(portable)  \n2\\. Wonderful sound clarity(minimum expectations from sony)  \n3.Less cost  \n  \nCons:  \n1\\. No cover or pouch to keep and carry  \n2.Can get scratches easily  \n3.Plastic feels so sensitive and breakable for rough usage.  \n  \nOverall, This is an affordable best quality headphones from Sony for a middle\nclass who can afford not more than 600 rupees along with Brand Warranty. What\nelse you need for this price. you may use this for an year and then upgrade\nyourself for a higher one.  \n  \nIf you found the review helpful please do press YES. :)\n\n", "Sound quality is fine but product is suspicious.  \nIt looks like I got duplicate.  \nAs you can see in pictures, in headphone picture, the name engraved is MDR-ZX\n110, but the name on website and package is MDR-ZX 110A. I don\u2019t know if this\nadditional A variant exists or not.  \nThe package is shouting fake. Headphone came in generic gray package, instead\nof Sony package \ud83d\udce6 . On the package no manufacturer details are given. Just\nsimple plain box with black and white sticker with Sony written on it.  \nPackage says \u201cmade in China\u201d I believe Sony products as made in Japan.  \nDidn\u2019t find any warranty card in the package.  \nIn all I believe I got the fake Sony headphone, but I\u2019m not returning it for\ntwo reasons.  \nFirst, don\u2019t want to go through all the hassle of return process, and second\nthe sound quality is quite a good so I\u2019m keeping it.  \nUsually in non branded headphones, one speaker stops functioning after six\nmonths or year. But it\u2019s good deal for 100 or 200 rupees.  \nFor this I\u2019ve spend 600, so let see how long it lasts.\n\n", "THIS IS NOT A SPONCERD REVIEW  \n=================================  \n-WHATS IN THE BOX-  \n====================  \n1\\.

Using a brand name that has been carefully\nbuilt up over the decades, Sony is one of a handful of companies in India that\ncan sell headphones by the thousand. This is thanks to a huge portfolio\nspanning various price ranges, from as little as Rs. 590, going up to Rs.\n41,990.  \nOne of Sony's most popular on-ear models is also one of its cheapest: the Rs.\n990 MDR-ZX110. Boasting Sony's iconic design, the ZX110 is a budget champion\nand one of the best selling personal audio products in India. Can Sony deliver\nat such a low budget? We find out in our review.  \nDesign, specifications and comfort  \nThe Sony MDR-ZX110 looks fancy and expensive from a distance, with a\ncombination of matte and gloss finishes on the body that comes across as more\npremium than anything else we've seen at this price. However, up close it\nfeels strictly budget. The plastic is flimsy and bendy, and does not look or\nfeel like it can take too much abuse, so careful handling is advised.  \n  \nThis headset has a rather unique folding mechanism that allows the ear cups to\ntwist inwards, into the headband. This makes the MDR-ZX110 a bit easier to\nstore when not in use. Apart from this, the Sony MDR-ZX110 has 30mm dynamic\ndrivers, with a frequency response range of 12-22,000Hz, 24Ohms impedance and\na sensitivity rating of 98dB. The MDR-ZX110 doesn't have an inline mic or\nremote control, but Sony does sell a nearly identical model, the MDR-ZX110AP\nwhich does, for Rs. 700 more.  \n  \nThe ear cups have very slight padding, which is enough for an acceptably\ncomfortable on-ear fit. The headband has no cushioning, but is designed well\nand feels secure and comfortable in place. The MDR-ZX110 also has a thick,\ntough cable that looks like it can take a fair bit of strain. Past the\nY-splitter, the 1.2m cable splits into two separate and somewhat flat cables\nthat aren't quite as sturdy as the lower half. The design and thickness makes\nthe cable somewhat tangle resistant, and extremely resistant to cable noise.\nOn the whole, apart from the flimsiness, we're happy with how the Sony MDR-\nZX110 looks and feels.  \n  \nPerformance  \nWith the Sony MDR-ZX110 being an entry-level on-ear headset, we did most of\nour testing using an Android smartphone. We also tried it with our Fiio X1\nhigh-resolution audio player and a Windows laptop. Focus tracks for the review\nwere BT's Somnambulist, Skrillex and Diplo's To U, and Passenger's Circles.  \n  \nStarting with the bass-heavy Somnambulist, we found that the Sony MDR-ZX110\nhad a meaty sound, with lots of emphasis on low-end attack. The bass can\noccasionally be overpowering, but is usually controlled thanks to the not-so-\ntight fit. The sonic signature has been tuned toward promoting the lows, and\nthis makes for a very warm sound. This also tends to show a bit in the lower-\nmid ranges, but there is a clear sensitivity drop towards the upper end of the\nfrequency range.  \nNext, we cued up To U, which despite being a dubstep track, has plenty to\noffer in terms of the mid-range and detail. While the Sony headset is\nimpressive in low-end detail, it seems to trail off going up the range. The\nresult is a sound that isn't quite as open and detailed as we'd like, even at\nthis price. Other products such as the Sennheiser HD180 offer better levels of\ndetail at this price, so the MDR-ZX110 isn't something we'd recommend if\nyou're looking for sonic clarity.  \n  \nFinally, with Circles, we kept our ears open for imaging and soundstaging.\nWhile the Sony offers a full and aggressive presentation in the sound, it\nfalls a bit short in terms of openness and width. The sonic stage feels narrow\nand specific, rather than properly spread out. However, the MDR-ZX110\ncertainly does its bit to make your music immersive and entertaining,\nespecially if you like your headphones bassy and aggressive  \n  \nVerdict  \nThe Sony MDR-ZX110 might look good and carry forward the typical aesthetic\nthat makes Sony a popular headphone option, but it falls a bit short in terms\nof build quality. It feels cheap and we were always worried about damage\nduring our time with the review unit. However, it offers an immersive, full\nsound that excels in its handling of bass. Detail and clarity suffer a bit,\nbut bass-heads will not find too much to complain about at this price. If\nyou're looking for a pair of on-ears with serious attack and drive at under\nRs. 1,000, the Sony MDR-ZX110 should be on your wish list.  \n  \nPrice (MRP): Rs. 990  \n  \nPros  \nComfortable on-ear design  \nGood low-end response  \nSturdy cable  \nFull, exciting sound  \nCons  \n  \nFlimsy build  \nWeak mids and highs  \nRatings (Out of 5)  \n  \nDesign: 3.5  \nPerformance: 3.5  \nValue for money: 4  \nOverall: 3.5  \n  \nTHANKS FOR READING THIS FULL ARTICLE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION YOU CAN VISIT ON\nOUR CHANNEL \"TECH HARSH TALKS\" THANKS (ONCE AGAIN).\n\n", "**********  \nDESIGN  \n**********  \nThe headphone features a swivel design that folds flat for portability. The\nentire headphone is made out of somewhat cheap feeling plastic, but the glossy\nand circular sides add a nice effect. The headphone jack isn\u2019t gold plated by\nthe way, some of you might care about that.  \nThe construction of the headphone is very intuitive, and you\u2019ll open up the\ncups like\u2026  \nAs you would expect, you can adjust the length of the band to fit your head. I\nfound the range of lengths to be perfect, still with extra length to spare for\nmy head that came with 6\u2032 1\u2033 body. You can also see that it comes with a\nY-type cord. While I personally prefer a one sided cord for less interferance,\nits tangle-free material makes up for it.  \n  \n*****************  \nEXPERIENCE  \n*****************  \n  \nWhen you put on the headphone, it honestly feels like any other on-ear\nheadphone at first. Its lightweight body doesn\u2019t put any pressure on top of my\nhead, and sits as expected with some padding as you can see. As long as you\ndon\u2019t go running with it, I could see this to last long before wearing out.  \n  \n*********************  \nSOUND QUALITY  \n*********************  \nListening to some pop songs at first left me speechless, and couldn\u2019t believe\nhow such a cheap headphone could deliver the bass and clear vocal I was\nhearing. It sounds quite amazing for its value. The 30 mm driver is able to\nproduce not just noticeable but pleasant bass.  \nIt sounds incredible with rich bass. Maybe I expected much less from an\ninexpensive headphone, but Sony did a great job with this headphone that\ndoesn\u2019t disappoint with its sound.  \n  \n*******  \nPROS  \n*******  \n  \n\\+ Amazing sound for the price  \n  \n\\+ Affordable  \n  \n\\+ Lightweight  \n  \n\\+ Folds flat, easily portable  \n  \n*******  \nCONS  \n*******  \n  \n\u2013 Plastic may feel cheap  \n  \n\u2013 No carrying pouch or case  \n  \n\\---------------------------------XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-----------------------------------------\n\n", "5/5 Rating Nice Headphones and Cushions are good.
