So I called up the warranty\n1-800 number. Right from the automated IVR to the point someone picked up the\ncall was very quick (no random inputs requested ... your zip code or input\nyour product code or what not). Then, the person who picked up was extremely\nprofessional and thorough. He took the info he needed from me and explained to\nme the process that would be followed. He even asked if I preferred home\nservice or would like to take the product to a nearby service center. After I\nsaid I preferred the home service option he told me to expect a call to\narrange for a visit within 4 hours before we hung up. Thereafter, I received\nSMS and emails confirming the case and timely updates on when it had been\nassigned, etc. Promptly I received a call in the evening asking when I shall\nbe available on the next day (which was a Sunday). Then, on the following day,\nat the expected time, I received a call from the technician confirming my\naddress and that I am at home. The technician arrived promptly, had brought\nthe necessary equipment with him to test/examine the product out and soon\ndetermined that something internal was wrong in the device (and that the\ncharger was okay). He immediately handed over a replacement unit to me, took\nmy signature, etc., gave some additional tips about maintaining the device and\nleft.  \n  \nThis was the smoothest warranty service experience I have *ever* had with\n*any* product, period!

I bet, You won't regret after\nbuying and using this.  \nHere is my review after using it for 2 years.  \n  \nAdvantages- Looks wise it's superb, Blue-black color combination is the\nperfect.  \n\\- The feature that catches everyone's eye is Rotating wheel to increase the\nlength of the comb, you can simply adjust yourself on your depndinh and needs.  \n\\- You can also remove the comb if you wish and believe me It doesn't hurt you\nat all like other cheap brand trimmer does. It provides you the zero shaving\nas possible.  \n\\- You can simply register your trimmer on philips' official website and can\navail your warranty. In my case I got two years + one year extended warrenty.  \n  \nDisadvantages - If a led light or an indicator have provided, it would be easy\nto know weither it is full charged or not.  \n\\- Well charging time and discharging time never bothered me much but when we\nsee it in instructions it scarifies you first that you will have to charge 10\nhours to get 45 minutes of working.  \n\\- There is no any other cons that I found so far in two years.  \nHope this will help you out, Thanks.\n\n", "A satisfying product coz I was nt dat sure about how I would receive the\nproduct bt it was an amazing product\n\n", "More than good and working fastly and processr are and mindbloind code system\n\n", "All my electronics are by Philips loved it with this love i purchased this\ntrimmer fully satisfied full paisaa vasul got it in amazon great indain sale\nwith 35% discount loved Amazon great Indian sale and Philips\n\n", "Product is good\n\n", "As always, it\u2019s a Philips promise....  \nAwesomely good product with a very low humming sound and the detachable part\nis ergonomic so much so that you\u2019ll never find it difficult to clean, wash or\nhandle it while traveling or finding a place in your bag.  \nThe battery backup is like never before phenomenon for it gives a full hour\nbackup with minimum 4 hours charging.
