You must Check recycling number.  \nNo brand is above board. For your health and well being you must be vigilant.\nMany premium water bottles are been sold as safe but are actually PET or with\nharmful plastics.  \n>>> The recycling numbers 1, 3, 6 and 7 should be avoided for use as water\nbottles. These numbers are indicated inside the triangular recycling symbol.  \n  \nIn the product description there is no mention of the type of plastic used or\nthe recycling numbers . Virgin plastic and food safe plastic are vague terms\nand don't indicate the kind of plastic used.  \n  \nThe first thing I checked after unpacking the bottles was the bottom where the\nrecycling number is indicated inside a triangle.  \nTwo bottles have the triangle and two don't !!  \nThe number inside the triangle is not easy to read. This is the most important\npart of the bottle meant for water storage. Why is Tupperware not transparent\nwith sharing the recycling numbers. Are they selling inferior quality to us\nIndians? From different angles they appear as different numbers.  \nWhat type of plastic is used for making these bottles? With out recycling\nnumbers there is no guarantee of safety \ud83d\udc4e  \n  \nErgonomics, color, looks are all secondary in a water bottle.  \nThe most important aspect is the safety. The water we shall consume from these\nbottles every day has to be free from chemicals that can get leached into it\nfrom the bad plastic.  \n  \nThey are good looking and well designed bottles  \nI received , blue, green, yellow and orange colours. They are transparent and\nthe caps fit well and are leak proof.  \nNo issues with the appearance but quality of plastic ?????  \nI think the Number on two bottles is five. Numbers 2, 4 and 5 are safe\nplastics.  \nI returned H2O bottles from cello as they had recycling No. 1 clearly marked\nin the bottom but the Tupperware bottles don't even show the number clearly.  \n  \nNot expected this from Tupperware. \ud83d\udc4e\n\n", "First of all note that it's PET number is 2 & not 5. The answers in the\nquestions section also misguided me because many have said that it is 5. Also\nthe bottles which are supposed to have that printed on their bottoms are\nmissing the needed info. which raised doubts regarding it's genuinity.  \n  \nPET stands for 'polyethylene terephthalate', which is the resin grade used in\nthe manufacturing of the product.  \n  \nThese bottles are PET 2, which are relativey safer than 1 but it is high\ndensity polyethylene which is generally used for toys, chairs milk jugs etc,\nbut not safe enough for water storage for longer periods. They release\nantimony and phthalates over time so it is better to avoid such.  \n  \nPET 5 is polypropelene which is a thermostatic polymer, which is used in\nmanufacturing of plastic cups, baby bottles, kitchen & microwaveable plastic\ncontainers. So it is better to opt 5.  \n  \nPaying around 900 for these grade 2 bottles is too expensive and not safe.  \nif glass & steel bottles are not possible at least opt for PET 5 bottles,\nwhich are not as carcinogenic as other grades. hope this info. helps.  \ncheers.\n\n", "I recieved different quality(low) 2nd time. I ordered the product twice n I\nreceived Good first time n low quality 2nd time. If u see the picture I hav\nsent U see the bottom of bottle, its 2 printed on it, all 4 bottles I ordered\n2nd time had this number, the one I ordered first, had a symbol something like\nthis with a fork and thats very good quality \u264e. I felt cheated 2nd time. Be\ncareful to order\n\n", "I received four different colored bottles in a plastic bag but there was no\ndamage or dents to the bottles. The Tupperware logo is embossed on the bottles\nand caps so I think it should be genuine. The quality of the plastic is much\nbetter than the regular bottles found in the marketplace.

Under the cap of it is clearly\nwritten 5 inside the triangle.  \nPacking was amazing and I recieved all the caps along with bottle.

I checked all four\nbottles and it says PET 5. However the bag it came in says PET 2. But this\nmight just be a case of improper packing from the seller. Apart from this the\npacking was good and all bottles came in good shape. As usual Amazon was fast\nin delivery. My only negative is that the bottles are a little too big (fat)\ncompared to your average bottle. This makes them hard to hold in your palm and\nonly two bottles fit in my fridge shelf where there used to fit 3 average\nbottles.\n\n", "Top brand for cooling your thirst.

When comparing with that bottles, this feels light, more transparent.\n(Which may get the feeling that the quality is not good or sturdy) But I must\nsay that it is able to handle hot water just fine, while washing it. I use\nthis bottle\u00a0for refrigerator and keep it at my desk. I don't use this for hot\nwater. (Be it Tupperware or any other PET bottles, I don't use that to fetch\nhot/warm water). I have a vacuum steel flask for that purpose. Those who want\nto use for the purpose of office/home use, go for it, it worth every penny.  \n  \nI don't recommend using a Tupperware for travel purpose (car/train/bus),\nbecause it may expose to direct sunlight without your notice and it may\ncontaminate your water, you may never know. Keep it indoors.\n\n", "Good but material is thin when compared to other tupperware bottle\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 25 September 2017", "on 13 October 2016", "on 22 March 2018", "on 29 August 2017", "on 16 September 2017", "on 9 September 2017", "on 16 June 2017", "on 30 December 2017", "on 1 November 2016", "on 15 August 2016"], "reviewer": ["prem prateek", "Amazon Customer", "Amazon Customer", "guru", "AB", "Praveen Prakash", "VijaySrinivas Vittalam", "Mohsin", "Prajith", "Koushik Anand"]}
