You must Check recycling number.  \nNo brand is above board. For your health and well being you must be vigilant.\nMany premium water bottles are been sold as safe but are actually PET or with\nharmful plastics.  \n>>> The recycling numbers 1, 3, 6 and 7 should be avoided for use as water\nbottles. These numbers are indicated inside the triangular recycling symbol.  \n  \nIn the product description there is no mention of the type of plastic used or\nthe recycling numbers . Virgin plastic and food safe plastic are vague terms\nand don't indicate the kind of plastic used.  \n  \nThe first thing I checked after unpacking the bottles was the bottom where the\nrecycling number is indicated inside a triangle.  \nTwo bottles have the triangle and two don't !!  \nThe number inside the triangle is not easy to read. This is the most important\npart of the bottle meant for water storage. Why is Tupperware not transparent\nwith sharing the recycling numbers. Are they selling inferior quality to us\nIndians? From different angles they appear as different numbers.  \nWhat type of plastic is used for making these bottles? With out recycling\nnumbers there is no guarantee of safety \ud83d\udc4e  \n  \nErgonomics, color, looks are all secondary in a water bottle.  \nThe most important aspect is the safety. The water we shall consume from these\nbottles every day has to be free from chemicals that can get leached into it\nfrom the bad plastic.  \n  \nThey are good looking and well designed bottles  \nI received , blue, green, yellow and orange colours. They are transparent and\nthe caps fit well and are leak proof.  \nNo issues with the appearance but quality of plastic ?????  \nI think the Number on two bottles is five. Numbers 2, 4 and 5 are safe\nplastics.  \nI returned H2O bottles from cello as they had recycling No. 1 clearly marked\nin the bottom but the Tupperware bottles don't even show the number clearly.  \n  \nNot expected this from Tupperware. \ud83d\udc4e\n\n", "Awsome product had previously given 1 star and on both occassions the review\nwas not posted.  \nThese are not original Tupperware there is no #5 mark which is present in all\nTupperware products.  \nAlso the material seems to be very light will definately break if falls down.  \nHad returned the product and got refund.\n\n", "I had purchased Tupperware Aquasafe Water Bottle Set a year back, and I've\noverall good experience.  \n  \nHere are my observations:  \n  \n1\\. The product looks similar to its pics on Amazon.  \n2\\. These bottles are very durable. Easy to clean. No issue of foul smell. The\nlook is perfect.  \n3\\. The product is as per my expectation, and I don't have any complaint as\nsuch.  \n4\\. Tupperware products have always been costly. So the cost of bottles didn't\nsurprise me.  \n  \nVerdict: I don't have any complaint\n\n", "I received four different colored bottles in a plastic bag but there was no\ndamage or dents to the bottles.
