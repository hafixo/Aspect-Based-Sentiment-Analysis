So hopefully so have great idlis\ntmrw. Will be eager to see how it turns out.  \nI thought of helping other to understand how \"big\" the steel drum is:  \nI weighed (with weighing scale) that it can hold 5.25litre of water. That\nmeans:  \n1) 2litre of wet grinder = 5.25litre of water holding capacity  \n2) 1litre of wet grinder = 2.7litre of water holding capacity (I simply halved\nit. I don't own 1litre wet grinder)  \n  \nThis should help you to understand how \"BIG\" ACTUALLY the steel drum is.  \nWill update the review in coming months.  \nHappy grinding!  \n  \n25 Sep 2017:  \nUsing this for almost 3 months. Working great. Batter turns out wonderful and\nfluffy.  \n1) One tip: After you are done grinding remove batter in a atleast 1litre +\nlarge container than usual as the batter ferments well and becomes fluffy.\nEarlier we used to remove in our regular patela... But noticed the batter\nspills overnight during fermenting. So switched to larger patela.  \n  \n2) I also read some comments about lose lid.... Well I think the lid is not\nsuppose to fit AIR TIGHT... Otherwise how do you imagine air to get into the\nbatter while grinding??!!!  \nIf you are gentle and kind enough the lid should last you years if YOU ARE\nCAREFUL.  \n3) Batter that we make in this usually half the drum capacity last us one week\nand use it three times a week. Mom grinds on Saturday... Use it for the week\nfollowing. We family of 3 maharashtraian with average skills of making idli\ndosa. But this machine helps you reach better level with batter quality.  \n4) It is not noisy at all. If you are used to television volume at normal\nlevel you won't even notice this machine working at all.  \n5) We usually grinder dal & rice together and leave it to run for 45min\nwithout bothering it. Idlis and dosa turns out fantastic. Idlis are soft,\npaper dosa is actually paper dosa and uttapa actually soft and fluffy.  \n6) While grinding place the lid as it might get splashed a little. Not too\nmuch but little.  \n7) You will stop using mixer grinder for idli grinding for generations to\ncome.  \n8) Add water while grinding in interval of 10-15min untill you figure out the\nconsistency. Once confident then you can add at once.  \n9) Scoop out the batter with regular Karchi. After than remove the conical\nstones in big plate and you can scoop the batter with hands.  \n10) They give the scooper white in colour but my mom's is more comfortable\nwith hands than that plastic device.  \n11) The motor heats up midly in 45min... Not much. That should bother you.  \n12) Wash it yourself, wipe dry and assemble and keep it. Last thing you want\nis maid to handle stones roughly.  \n13) I like the design as it is easy to use and understand without not much\nover do.  \n  \nWhen I get married I'm going to purchase one more of this and take it with me\nas \"Dahej\" :P  \n  \nBest product on Amazon I ever purchased!\n\n", "Good product, it has been six months still working fine.. In 2 litre grinder\nthis one is best\n\n", "Product delivered today, looks and body are excellent but main problem I m\nseeing with grinding... It's taking more than 1hr for grinding of less than\n.5kg only...  \nCan anybody help this is product fault or this is expected time to grind of\nthis product?  \nAny suggestions would help me better to decide about return...  \nThanks in advance!\n\n", "pathetic product.. had to return the product twice. first time, the grinder\nstopped working after mins of use. Requested for a replacement product but the\none which got delivered was defective too (base was broken and the wire\ndamaged). Now am having issues with following up in getting the refund issued\n:(\n\n", "I got item now product is cracked see the image I'm going to return it and\ninvoice is generated some others name and address  \nBut delivery address is mine\n\n", "Love it.. !! Grinds so fast and smooth..!! Batter comes so fluffy!! yummy\nidli!! Best product. and a must buy!! seen some negative comments as the lid\nis not air tight!! Lid is just for the purpose to prevent dust entering into\nthe batter while grinding.!! air circulation is required whil grinding so the\nlid serves its purpose.!!! for medium family this is the best grinder.\n\n", "1) Well packaged and arrived in good condition  \n2) Lovely idlis, dosa, vada, adai, pesarattu, etc have been made  \n3) Did not buy Chappati Atta kneader or Coconut scraper; so cannot comment  \n4) Easy to wash post flour preparation  \n5) Suitable for family of 6 to 8 members - 6A + 2 C - in 1 round\n\n", "Product delivered not that much good. noise coming from power button.\n\n", "It's really great even in North India we do prepare lot's of Dishes with Urad\nDAL specially at holi and Festival and even Occasionally my mother is Really\nhappy and I am going to order soon another one as we have two houses Thank's\nAmazon just request for Proper Packing and if you really want to get great\nresult go for it ....Thank's\n\n", "excellent product.
