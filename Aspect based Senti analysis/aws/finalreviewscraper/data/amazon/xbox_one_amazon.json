Now to the experience with the pathetic Microsoft service.  \nThe support from Microsoft is just pathetic, I don't get any replies to the\nmails. Had to wait for 45 minutes and listen to the waiting tunes on the call\ncentre number and then got disconnected without having any conversation. Then\non the online chat which is half the time non functional, I somehow got\nthrough to an agent who said he'd scheduled the return pickup. Then I waited\nand waited, nothing came. Again went through the whole process to find out if\nI'm lucky enough to contact the Xbox help centre, After a lot of attempts,\nagain somehow got through to an agent in the online chat. He said that the\nprevious agent missed out on scheduling the return label itself and he created\nthe same for me after making me wait for more than an hour. Then he was also\nnot sure about the process to follow through which I can send back the\nproduct. He said he'll get back to me by eod, for which even after 48 hours\nI'm waiting for. Even in doing the return schedule he committed a mistake, he\nscheduled it as a refund, for which I got it corrected.. Then wrote to\nMicrosoft asking for the process, nothing came so far.  \nHence, I packed the Xbox console as given in the website and approached the\nFedEx people, they refused to take in the parcel as the pickup is not\nscheduled by Microsoft. This is really painful, If this is going to be the\nexperience for a person who buys an Xbox, I'm really really sorry... No wonder\nSony is the one which everyone's recommending. And I feel like being an idiot,\nhaving taken this decision to buy an Xbox.  \nThe return label is created for 7 days, and I believe it expires today. And\ntoday again I waited for half an hour listening to your waiting tunes just to\nget disconnected and the online chat is always showing the status as closed.\n\n", "Had some doubts upgrading to this from my ancient launch day XB1. This really\nis a sleek machine. Brilliant industrial and contemporary design at the same\ntime. The white colour really pops amidst my all black entertainment unit. So\nfar really cool during gameplay  \nAnd feels faster in just about everything. Love the small size and the\nstormtrooper look.\n\n", "It's been a good buying experience overall except for the fact that I am yet\nto receive/hear about the other two games as promised along with the product,\nso the ratings as seen\n\n", "Though I own all the consoles. I must say ps4 still beats the Xbone. Ofcourse\nI have a msi ge73vr 7rf laptop but we are comparing consoles here. Xbox one\nhas dynamic resolution scaling therefore graphics looks better in ps4 in\nsimilar games.  \nMy advice buy Xbox one to enjoy exclusives like gears of war or quantum break,\nbut if u have pc then go for ps4.\n\n", "The Xbox One S is a great console for a great price. It runs smoothly\nsupporting 4K as well as HDR gaming. Though if you already own the original\nXbox One, there is not much of a point to make the upgrade to the S.  \nThe Xbox One S is considerably smaller than the original Xbox One. In fact,\nMicrosoft states that it is 40% smaller than the original release. On top of\nthis, you don\u2019t have to worry about the big external brick of a power supply,\nbecause now it is built in straight to the console. This helps quite a bit\nsince the original power supply was basically as big as the console itself.  \nAs a gamer in advancing years, this is my first Xbox of any description and I\nwould like to give other young at heart gamer's a more balanced perspective\nand help them overcome any techno fears that they may have. My previous\nexperience of modern games machines has been limited to the Wii which I\nenjoyed very much but did have its limitations.  \nPROS  \n\\- Plug and play. Ensure that your WiFi is on, connect the Xbox to the tv\nusing an HDMI lead, connect the power lead and put 2 x AA batteries into the\ncontroller (I can recommend the rechargeable power packs available from\nAmazon). Turn on the Xbox and it will guide you through the set up process.\nYou will need to set up a Microsoft account if you don't already have one.  \n\\- No need for a separate Blu-Ray/DVD player  \n\\- Access to Amazon, Netflix etc  \n\\- Supports 4K Blu-Ray/DVD  \n\\- Quite compact and no external PSU  \n\\- WiFi controller  \n\\- Easy to navigate menus with plenty of content  \n\\- Very little or no noise  \n\\- Ability to connect an external hard drive. Currently a cheaper option than\nbuying the 1TB or 2TB Xboxes.  \n\\- My wife is very happy with the lack of clutter behind the tv now that the\nDVD, Blu_ray player, Fire stick, Wii and all the PSU's and leads have\nvirtually gone.  \n\\- Stands upright for space saving (with appropriate stand, available at a\nvery reasonable price from Amazon)  \nCONS  \n\\- Games on disc need to be downloaded onto the hard drive (20-30 minutes,\ndepending on connection speed as the game invariably needs an update)  \n\\- Some bundled games, in my case Battlefield 1, have to be downloaded online\nas there is no disc just a code. In my case this took nearly eight hours to\nfully load at an average speed of 22 MB/S (BT Infinity)  \n\\- 500GB storage. 5-6 games and this is virtually full. (See PROS above re\nexternal drive)  \n\\- Controller buttons hard to see in low light (Being picky here and I dare\nsay that once you memorize which button is where it won't be a problem but\nback lighting would be good for us not so young as my memory is about as good\nas my eyesight!)  \nOverall I'm very happy with my Xbox. I do hope they fix the OS issues and I\ndid take a star away for that, but at the end of the day I think it's a great\nconsole.\n\n", "I would not say it\u2019s the best console bcz as we all know that project Scorpio\n(Xbox one x) is out there which is the most powerfull console ever.  \nLet me straight away tell you it\u2019s pros and cons :  \nPros:  \n1.Light weighted beautiful hardware packed console which is 40% smaller than\nthe original Xbox one.  \n2\\. No more additional power brick is there!!  \n3\\. We can use it in INDIA directly without using the voltage step down\nconverter.  \n4.specs are a bit less as compare to PS4 slim but games do lags on ps4 slim\nbut over Xbox one s games runs super smooth with HDR and 4K upscaling.  \n5\\. Best blue ray 4K player  \n6.best controller ever built in the market  \n7\\. Xbox has many advantages over PS4  \nAs it deliver better frame rates and graphics even though it is slightly less\npowerful than it  \n8\\. Can use Netflix content in 4K quality directly on this console.  \n9.you do not have to charge the controller every 5 minutes as I\u2019m like in PS4\n. Batteries can work last upto 1week if used regularly.  \n10\\. You can play backward compatible games as well.  \n11\\. I will not provide ratings for looks ,quality or design etc cz the whole\npurpose of providing this review is to make u understand briefly regarding\nthis product.  \nCons:  \n1\\. Still consoles needed batteries  \n2\\. No other cons I\u2019ve faced right now  \n  \nVerdict : if you are buying a console for the first time or switching from\nXbox 360 or PS3 then go for it or else go for project Scorpio or PS4 pro\n\n", "This is a huge upgrade as it now has HDR, 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, and 4K\nstreaming video. It\u2019s actually good-looking. The console looks nice and is a\nbit small.  \nPros------------  \n  \nSmaller than Xbox One  \n4K game upscaling  \nIt's a cheap UHD Blu-ray player  \nHDR compatible  \nImproved, grippy controller  \nCons-------------  \n  \nNot native 4K in games  \nreview imagereview imagereview image\n\n", "Two months of owning this, and it\u2019s hands down the best entertainment device\nI\u2019ve owned!  \n  \nI\u2019ve always got my consoles from the US as they cost half of what they do here\nbut I bought this here so I could have DRM-free, region-free peace of mind as\nwell as tech support if needed. I\u2019m not too particular about playing the\nlatest game immediately at launch, I\u2019ll play them at some point of time, so\nwith the combined Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass subscriptions, I\u2019ll never\nhave to buy another game again.  \n  \nNow coming back to the console itself, it can play Blu Ray disks, connect to\nyour TV and control your tv from your Xbox controller or using the Xbox Remote\napp, or even watch Amazon Videos and YouTube. It\u2019s a home entertainment system\nand not just a gaming console. I power the system on using the iOS app when I\ncome home, choose a TV show on Amazon Video and sit back, all without even\nswitching the Xbox Controller on. It\u2019s that easy! Also some people have asked\nme about game downloads in the background. Yes, it downloads games in the\nbackground if Instant Power-on is selected as an option, and plus point is it\nswitches on in 10 seconds if this option remains enabled. If you\u2019re someone\nwho games at night, you\u2019ll like the option of connecting your earphones or\nheadphones to the controller and enjoying your game with the home theater\nsystem turned off. And yes, best coupled with a 5.1 home theatre system and a\n40+ inches Full HD TV.  \n  \nOverall, an excellent buy. Have to mention that the 5 stars is for the\nproduct. For Amazon, I\u2019d rate the buying experience a frustrating 2 stars.\nCustomer Service was pathetic. And I would have liked it if Amazon had not\ndelayed the free game codes, I got them nearly 3 weeks and 2 escalations\nlater.\n\n", "Used it for a couple of weeks. I'm a pc gamer who Purchased this originally as\na backup system for games and Internet. Went in with super low expectations.\nCame out on the other end insanely happy.  \n  \nThings would look crisp on a 1080p tv despite it having only a 1.4 TF gpu (for\nreference a rx 580 is 6 teraflops) this console is great for the price and\nwhat it provides.  \n  \nFor people here trying to decide between XB and PS ecosystems I'll make it\neasy for you  \n  \n1) if playing and experiencing different games is your first priority / and or\nif you already have a PC, go the PlayStation route.  \n  \n2) if you're buying this as a first console or a backup system, don't really\ncare about letting go of 2-3 sony games like horizon, uncharted or spiderman\netc , it's perfect. Comes with the really feature rich Microsoft ecosystem, 4k\nuhd blu-ray playback etc.\n\n", "Perfect Media and entertainment center for the price I have paid for . Ordered\nit from Amazon.com (US)during the holiday season and got it for 12.3k INR . So\nif you are considering to buy one just check with any of your friends or\nrelatives who can get it from US or UAE where we will get it at half price.\nJust try out your luck  \n  \nI am not really into games but was looking for a decent 4k Blu-ray player and\nafter so much research I thought to order Xbox one s because of the price and\nthe kind of options that I am getting with it. Picked up the forza bundle and\nit will download the game which is 57GB .  \n  \nThe console is sleek , very silent and no heating issues at all during\nprocessing.  \n  \nSo am overall happy with my purchase\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 10 November 2017", "on 9 October 2017", "on 17 October 2017", "on 10 October 2017", "on 10 October 2017", "on 8 October 2017", "on 16 November 2017", "on 1 December 2017", "on 17 February 2018", "on 12 January 2018"], "reviewer": ["Amzzz", "Dr Evil", "Prajish", "SEPHIROTH", "SwordFish", "Shubham", "Shryansh", "Santosh", "Rajitha", "Akbar"]},

I don't have any problem downloading Xbox one\ngames which ranges btw 40-50gb since I have superfast 40mbps broadband\nconnection. I will recommend you guys to have minimum 16mbps connection if you\nwant to buy Xbox one because most of the games need update in order to remove\nbugs if any or for multiplayer.  \n  \nNote: I got 3 free games code in my email after 15 days. U need to order from\ncloudtail seller in order to get those 3 free game codes.You will get 1 year\nwarranty only if u order from cloudtail seller otherwise u won't get any\nwarranty. To check ur Xbox warranty type Xbox one warranty on Google open the\nlink and enter serial number of ur console after signing in with ur Xbox id on\nMicrosoft website.
