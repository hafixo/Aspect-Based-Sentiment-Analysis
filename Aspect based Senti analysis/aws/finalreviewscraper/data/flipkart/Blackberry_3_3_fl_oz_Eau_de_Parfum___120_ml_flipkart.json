{"rating": 1, "title": "Not upto mark", "review": "Sorry to say but Boss Grey Eau De Toilette received doesnot seems to be original. I have used this product in the past which i have purchased from departmental store. My experience was fantastic & so inclined to buy the same when seen on your website. To my surprise, the fragrance is not lasting longer even for one hour whereas earlier it was quite a long lasting experience. Highly disappointed with this product.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "14 Oct, 2014", "reviewer": "KAUSHAL DOSHI"},
