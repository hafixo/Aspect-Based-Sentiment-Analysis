I had de data on de whole day.. playing games ... Listening to music...etc I got screen on tym of abt 6 hrs... I charge my fone 18-20 hrs once.. so de battery will easily last a day for users like me...\n\n*The display is truly fantastic.. it has sharper color and video watching is an extreme delight in dis fone\n\n*The camera is very gud and has many modes to operate with... Some pics really seem to be shot on DSLR camera.. B-)\n\n*I did not find any lag till now... And all De apps vry smooth... Multi tasking is also very gud... Since it has 6.2\" screen, even multi window is vry nice to work with...\n\n*64GB internal storage is more than sufficient for my usage... Having about over 100+ apps and several photos , I have 28gb left in my fone... I don't use a memory card... Instead I use 2 SIM cards... \n\n*The phone can get charge in abt 1hr 40 mins from 0-100% as it has fast charging... \n\n*The earphone quality is very gud ... \n\n*The phone has no heating issues .. while charging it got little warm.. but while using heavy apps also I did not find any heating...\n\n*The iris and face recognition feature is also good ... The fingerprint sensor is also comfortable to use... U will get used with the position on day to day usage... I mostly use de iris scanner and rarely use de fingerprint scanner... Iris scanner work best in indoors... For outdoor usage I use the FINGERPRINT... \n\nCONS:\n\nI have no cons to say as for my usage... \n\nToo mch heavy users may need to charge their fone twice a day (NOTE: IT IS NLY FOR PEOPLE WHO SIT WITH FONE 24*7 and NOT for normal-heavy users)... \n\nFINAL REVIEW: IF THE PRICE DOESNT BOTHER U , surely go ahead and buy...", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "7 May, 2017", "reviewer": "Gopinath Ramasubramanian"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Cutting-edge features at a cut-throat price", "review": "I pre-ordered the Midnight Black S8+ on Flipkart and was pleasantly surprised to receive the phone a day earlier than promised, that too with a musical greeting card and a pocket organizer. You guys sure know how to delight your customers!\n\nThe phone, to put it simply, is magnificent.\n\nFor starters, the DISPLAY is simply jaw-dropping; so much that after an hour with the S8+, every other phone looks dated. The phone dimensions are almost identical to my Nexus 6p, but so much screen has been fit in that body that you feel like holding a shiny magic crystal. The colors are oversaturated in the factory settings, but switching the display color scheme to Basic ensures that color reproduction is accurate -- much like the sRGB mode in the 6p.\n\nComing from the Nexus' powerful CAMERA, I was initially worried with some preliminary selfies as they looked weird and smudgy. However, when I turned off all the so-called beautification filters, the results were infinitely better. The rear camera is flawless, and videos in 1080p 60fps are very smooth. I'll reserve my final judgement of the finer aspects of the camera such as low-light imaging until I've used it for a week or so, but so far, I am thoroughly satisfied.\n\nThe first 100 to 0 BATTERY cycle has given me a luxurious 6+ hours of SoT, and considering this is with a 'wow new phone' type of usage with constant app installs and gaming benchmarks, colour me thoroughly impressed so far.\n\nThe phone, though, has its share of issues that most professional reviewers have already covered so here's what I did not like:\n1. The fingerprint sensor positioning is bad, and does not have a different tactile feel compared to the camera lens.\n2. The Iris unlock is almost useless with my glasses on.\n3. Everything Bixby is useless -- the button, the app, and the vision add-on.\n4. Ultimately, the price. For me, this was an impulse-buy, and I frankly cannot justify spending the amount I did for this phone.\n\nOverall, if the price is not an issue, I wholeheartedly recommend this phone for anyone.\n\nYour move, Apple.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "3 May, 2017", "reviewer": "Ravi Teja Rachakonda"},
