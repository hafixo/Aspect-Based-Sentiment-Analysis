I have tried connecting with multiple flipkart service people ( Manish Katare, Avishek Sharma ) and they are saying sir your problem is genuine but we can't help you.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Good Phone but Let Down by Google Tech support in India.", "review": "My Issue:- Phone charger never really worked for my brand new phone . Out of box issue for a phone that still less than a month old. Imagine my disappointment after dumping old faithful iPhone and eagerly Preordering the phone, waiting weeks of delay in shipment, over coming scepticism around 'Blue screen tinge' and other issues only to get a out of box faulty device.\n\nGoogle's Resolution- After multiple calls and followups, i get back a old and dirty charger. Is it unfair for customer to ask the replacement part to be at least cleaned properly and be handed over . B2X guys just reached out into his pocket and took out this charger and gave it to me. No packaging and no box nothing.\nWhat I did not like  \n(a) Complete lack of Customer Centricity - they took 3 weeks to just give me back a dirty charger.That too after multiple (almost daily) calls to google support, escalation to to Managers at google support.\n(b) Delays in communicating to customer- Nobody at google support could really find out what caused a delay of so many weeks in getting me back my charger. What was surprising is that Google was not even able to communicate to me reason for the delay.on 20th I get a email confirming I will get my charger back and it takes another week and multiple calls from my side to get it back\n(c) Over dependence of Google on 3rd party providers:- Google sells Pixel phone though FLipkart and services though B2X and both these companies let me down. First Flipkart delayed my \"Pre ordered\" phone by more than 2 weeks and then B2X shoddy service just kills the enthusiasm of this new phone. My phone calls to Google support made me realise that all Google guy can do was call up his counterpart in B2X and request them to expedite or raise a complaint at their end. None of which works and it leaves the customer feeling helpless.\n\nConclusion- Very good phone but extremely poor service.Google is years away from catching up with Apple in India.Pixel buyers are usually come from a market segment of knowledgeable customers and we have options with us while making a buying decision. A good hardware with poor service is not what helps you win market share. Unless Google invests in opening it's own stores, Own service centers or atl east strong control over service providers then no one will make a repeat purchase.

And this time i can really say google has done tremendous work for the past few years since i moved from nexus 6p. \nIn terms of software, i think apple has a lot of ground to cover. The machine learning and smooth apps and control over your system and freedom of app choices is something you would definately cheerish after moving from iOS. I felt reserved while using iPhone for twice in my lifetime as initially coming from symbian era iPhone was a dream and Android wasnt evolved that much. Hence, i had moved from iPhone to android and back to iPhone as i wasn't really impressed. This time with pixel 2 xl it feels good, infact i haven't left my ohone alone for last two days. \nYes, its excitement as well as so many small things improved in android and with google assistant it feels awesome. My wife's complaints have made me realise how amazing this device is that I'm using it continuously and can't get over it.\n\nThose who are bored of using iPhone or want something different, look nowhere else.

ALong with that it has the best camera in any phone right now and the battery life is exceptional for a high end flagship phone. I get around 6 hrs SOT(screen on time). To put a cherry on top, the front firing stereo speakers are a delight and sound really good.\n\nLastly, DO NOT go by the reviews of Pixel XL. The reviews talk about display issues such as screen burn-in and faded colours. Trust me on this, there are NO ISSUES. The only disadvantage I would say is the price of this device. But Flipkart was generous enough to give me massive discounts, so no complaints there. I got 64GB version of Pixel 2 XL for 48k.

It is supposed to be credited in 90 days but didn't get cashback yet (ordered on 11th Nov) . Flipkart is saying cashback posted and HDFC is saying cashback not posted. Neither of them are giving any evidence to counter the other party. Cashback on FlipKart sounds very much like fake\n\nPerhaps everyone would agree that Google pixel provides the best stock android experience with excellent camera. Though Oneplus 5T and Nokia 8 may provide good stock android experience, there are some unique advantages with Pixel but comes only with twice the price. It is is up to the individuals to decide. \n\nPros\n1. Google Pixel is the android's equivalent to iphone in terms on smooth experience. This phone is buttery smooth. I used Nexus 6P (with Oreo) before which itself was quite good but this one is awesome. Never noticed even hint of lag\n2. One of the best cameras in smart phone. Portrait mode on front camera is very good. Don't worry about lack of dual camera setup. Google is doing great job in software without a dual camera setup.\n3. Brand image of Google would look better than something like OnePlus.\n4. AI is going to be the future and Google is comfortably ahead of competitors . Google assistant is no gimmick and understand Indian accent very well.  Google lens  is an innovative idea. Remember all the new AI features are not going to be available first on other android devices.\n5. Unlimited storage for pictures/videos taken from Pixel. Instead of giving room for microSD card, Google provides much better option of saving in cloud. Cloud is better way to keep pictures and videos than keeping it in any physical storage devices.\n6. Pixel is going to get all the updates first (at least two months earlier than other phones)\n7. Build quality provides premium feel (it should be at this price point). \n8. Awesome battery life with fast charging\n9. Two years of warranty is simply outstanding.\n\nCons\n1. Price! Price! Price! If you only look for functional aspect of smartphone oneplus 5T and Nokia 8 would do pretty much of it with half the price. At least they could price lesser in Indian market to compensate the higher taxes. Oneplus is doing that. This would push more customers to buy in India even if they have opportunity to buy in other countries. \n2.  Bezeless looks is not good as other phones (Samsung glaxy s8, LG V30 etc) in this price range. Thicker side bezels and curved display edges are ugly. However, curved edges and overall look of the phone still gives premium look. Blue tint is blown out of proportion. At least on my unit it is just slight bluish look when viewed from a position nobody wants to look at the phone. \n3.  No earphone, No data cable to connect standard USB port on the computer,  Very short USB-C cable to the power brick. At this price point, it is completely unreasonable. \n4. On preorder, there was an offer to buy bluetooth earphone for Rs.1. I wonder why they didn't come up with such offer for Google earbuds (same price range). This is the offfer convinced me to buy in India though.\n\nOverall in conclusion, if you look for premium stock android phone with best camera go for it. If you are looking only the functional aspects do explore other options like Oneplus 5T or Nokia 8 (maybe even upcoming Nokia 9) before buying this.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "20 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "Mohan"},

Speaker: The speaker is loud enough than most phones out there (Reminds me of the speaker quality of iPhone 7 plus).\n2. Battery life: At first I thought that the battery life would be average, but it is well above average. It easily lasts me about a day and a half.(I am not a gamer, else in that case the battery life would differ a bit)\n3. Screen quality: It is not as bad as shown by others in all the YouTube videos out there, you need to experience it in person first before making an upfront decision. Use the phone at any mobile store first before making any purchase. You won't be disappointed.\n4. Proper RAM management: I have used phones from most tier 1 brands and the RAM management on this phone is exceptional. Transitions and animations are smooth enough. Apps open and close pretty fast. 4GB RAM is more than enough for most apps.\n5. Google Integration: Software optimisation by Google is top notch. Google assistant is available by simply  squeezing the bottom sides of the phone. Also Google lens is integrated in the camera app, it means that Google search can be launched directly from the image capture taken.\n6. Camera: Best camera out there with solid AI which recognises the subject and blurs the background in portrait mode. The portrait mode is available on both front and rear camera and is amazing. In India by default you won't get portrait mode on front camera, but simply googlng around you will get that functionality too.\n\nI seriously didint find any negative points about this phone.

Almost all the reviews say \"Almost perfect phone\" because of the display controversies. If that was the only issue for them,  then i can say this is \"the perfect phone\" so far because the display issues are overhyped. \nNow answers to the overhyped issues, let me say I myself can't stand any known flaws in my phone, it would keep bugging me, \n1. Dull colors - As everyone might already know there is a patch that gave color options which gives a saturated option that pops out colors.  But I feel the Natural and Boosted colors are very good. They are not washed out, we are just used to over saturated colors. Only when you compare this phone with saturated color phone you feel that.\n2. Blue Tint - I keep tilting my phone trying to find the too much blue tint people have been complaining about. Have been trying to reproduce.  Either its not there or it's not as noticeable as the reviews claimed.\n3. Blotchiness and Black smear  - I did notice the black smudge once when i was viewing a picture with black background and trying to move it up and down rapidly.

These two issues are something that will be noticed in testing scenario not in day to day use.\n\nEdit:Burn In Issue: Its almost 20 days since i have started using the phone, i am not able to reproduce this issue. \n\nBattery: Some blog claimed fast charging is not as fast.

People don't recognise it and accessories are limited (won't get the attention in crowd like an iPhone does). Spend only if you are looking for some serious software and camera. As comfortable to hold as other 18:9 devices. The more than usual screen to body ratio is due to speakers but it ain't no tradeoff. Extremely mature device. Blue shift is more like a character than a flaw. Hadn't bothered since beginning. Maybe Indian units don't have it that much. Battery lasts as long as iPhone 8 plus which for me is a personal battery benchmark. Rear camera is great as usual but where it embarrasses the iPhone is the front camera especially the portrait. Since it uses primary sensor for portraits there's no los in quality (leaving aside some zooming in), compared to dual lens setups where secondary sensors compromise on quality.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "19 Jan, 2018", "reviewer": "Devesh Sharma"},

Once I got the phone and powered on and went through the setup process and android upgrade etc.  the first thing I noticed was pale colors. Then I quickly went into advanced display settings, and selected \"Saturated\" - bingo - the colors are bright. I could not find much issue. If I tilt a little, the colors fade - but frankly if you have saturated colors turned on, not much issues. Also, the display brightness is always 50% or lesser normally, so slight reduction of maximum nits value has no impact in normal uses I guess. On the whole I am very happy with how my display is working. Its quite sharp. Will update after some time if I see any other issues.\n\nCamera: Outstanding - no need to go through anything much I guess. Checkout DxO mark site  - I agree completely with that. HDR+ is fast and low light performance is good. One thing I noticed though is very good audio recording and playback quality during video recording/playback from camera.\n\nPerformance & Battery: very smooth. Have been using for a week. no lags noticed anywhere. I configured office mails ( Outlook ), gmail, skype, whats app, location is always on - and use it through out the day for office and personal emails and communication. Also I use the Google news reader configured and frequently use the Google now. I listen to music for some time on bluetooth in my car during driving to office/home. My nexus 6p previously used to give up around 4:30 - 5 pm every day - but this almost goes to the next day morning - lasts through the night for me. I don`t do much gaming/youtube though normally - so can`t comment on those use cases.\n\nBluetooth / Wifi: So far no issues.

The presentation made by them really made me feel special. \n\nPros:\n- Lookwise there is no other phone better than it (super SEXY!!)\n- Easy to hold.\n- Fingerprint sensor is really nice and on perfect place.\n- Camera quality is exceptionally good. High video stability. Took a pic in low light without flash, was too much visible and clear. Digital flash in front camera and protrait mode in front camera also. \n- Unlimited storage on google photos.\n- Used phone continuously for 12-14 hrs, playing game, watching video, using GPS, listening to songs. Good battery backup.\n- Switching between apps very easy, doesn't hang.\n- Sennheiser headphones are way too awesome. Very comfortable. Good noise cancellation. 10 on 10 for it.\n- Android Oreo.\n\nCons\n- No headphone jack. (solution the provided by giving headphones. Ps: Not big problem)\n- Touch doesn't work sometimes on edges and in between also. (Hope another software update will fix it. Ps: Big problem)\n- Blue tint is there. (but it actually looks cool :D ps: Not a very big problem)\n- Doesn't charges fastly. It takes around 100 min to charge phone from 0 to 100%. (Not big problem)\n\nOverall I will rate it 4.7 out 5. Probably the best android experience ever. Best android phone available in market if they fix the screen problems. As they are providing 12k worth earphones, so the overall offer is worth for money.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Welcome to the future!", "review": "Google had nailed it. Best smart phone ever.\n\nUpdate after ten days off heavy use.\n\nTo summarise all my experience, I'll put this in bulleted text.\n1. Great software experience you'll get ever in a smart phone including iPhone's(please watch geekyranjit review of Pixel 2 XL for this comment). Specially iOS 11 it's so buggy.\n2. Great battery backup in any smart phone again. Yes. Any smart phone including midrange phone. Midrange phone don't have high-end quad HD display to push more pixels. But still this phone manages to get more than 6 hours of battery backup no matter whatever you do.\n3. Great front firing stereo speakers. They may not so much louder like iPhone X. But the hearing range and sound clarity it's great. I can say this much that you'll hear it one floor up or down, off you're listening music. It's so clear and wide reach.\n4. It didn't get heated up during extended browsing in Chrome, because of that plastic coated material on back and also because of better heat sink management. My OnePlus 3 get constantly heated up while browsing in Chrome.\n5. Google has said, they'll be providing atleast 3 years of software update. But I think it may go upto 4 years as this one support the project Treble. That's why Google said atleast 3 years. That means it may be more.\n6. Camera experience is terrific. No need to explain it.\n7. You have nailed it. The power button placement is little on top side which is not comfortable.\n8. My Pixel 2 XL doesn't have any blue colour shift on tilting. If you say, I can post a picture of it. Rather I'll say, it's colour management is something which I'm liking it lately as though I can switch to saturated mode, but I'm staying with boosted mode as it looks better and natural to me.\n\nLet me try honestly to clarify certain things, as I'VE already used this device for last ten days. It's light weight as the back don't have any glass or sides don't made up of stainless steel like iPhone X. About missing 3.5 mm headphones Jack, I think because of placement of stereo speakers on both the side they might not be getting placement to put that on top or bottom.\n\nI hope if any one find this post useful and buys this phone, her or she'll be very satisfied with her purchase decision. But price is something which may play a little hindrance. But once you cross that hurdle, of will be a very satisfying investment.\n\nThe boss is here. I'm posting this after only 7 hours of usage. The battery is insane. Over 6 hours already. I don't find any fault with the display and using the default boosted color mode though it's system update to November security patch.\n\nThese are only initial impression. Still to check the camera. I'll come back in couple of days for more in depth.\n\nUpdate after three days\n\n1. Consistently getting seven hours of battery. Standby time is excellent.\n2. Stereo speakers does sounds very best. Got the Sennheiser Bluetooth earbuds and they sound great like AudioTechnica M 50x. Not missing my wired hardiness at all. These are so convenient.\n3. Camera quality is insane. Just point and shoot. You'll get best of the image. Yet to take any video though.\n4. Smoothness is just top notch. Coming from OnePlus 3, if I can feel so much better smoothness then think about others.\n5. Launching Google Assistant is so much fun and at the same time so intuitive. This squeeze feature the made into this phone is not gimmick at all. You'll surprised to see how often you use it.\n6. No problem at all. No blue tint nothing. It's saturation and black lavel are amazing. Not comparing with Note 8. I'm not using it's saturated mode though it's available.\n7. In hand feel is just right. Very well balanced and grippy.\n\nInitially thought about the price a lot. But just took some calculated risk for the sake Google's credibility and I'm not disappointed. Just wondering how much Google has improved in design and hardware department. I'm an old Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 user.

Its just awesome (understating it).\n\n2)Camera - The best rear and front camera hands down as compared to any other phone in the market. The portrait mode on both front and rear cameras is better than all the dual cameras gimmicks that other companies give. Kudos to Google for their software.\n\n3)Speakers - The dual front facing speakers are really good. Playing games, listening music, watching movies is a treat.\n\n4)Battery - I easily get 1.5-2 days of battery life on a single charge. 6-7 hours of screen on time. What else you can ask for. \n\n5)Google Assistant - You have to use it to know how intelligent it has got.\n\n6)Design - My personal opinion but i just love my the black - white Pixel 2 XL. It is quirky yet classy and beautiful. \n\n7)Miscellaneous - Google lens,fingerprint scanner, latest and fastest Android updates for 3 years.\n\nCONS:\n1)Screen - a) Blue tint is quite visible while looking sideways. But nobody uses the phone looking sideways so the issue is blown out of proportion.\n                b) Their is smearing / stretching of black color objects on rapidly scrolling of screen or scrolling during low screen brightness or when the night mode is on. \n\n2)Charging - Although only twice (might be some bug) but it took 5-6 hours to fully charge the phone. \n\n3)Customer Support - Really a deal breaker. Does not reply to queries or call back even after repeatedly asking for the same. \n\nAll in all its the best smartphone out in the market. PERIOD!!!. The overpriced Iphones, bloatware full Samsung, Chinese One Plus are no comparison to this beauty. Plus the amazing discounts offered on Flipkart, its a steal (overhyping but true to some extent).", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "31 Dec, 2017", "reviewer": "Himanshu Verma"},

I contacted google and they tell me some tricks like reboot, factory data reset and calibrate the battery. I tried all but nothing happens. Not expeted this from 60000 rs phone. Learn a lesson from this. If someone want to buy costly phones than buy only apple or samsung. Sold this phone after 1.5 month at rs.30000 at huge loss.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Perfect product!", "review": "After going through lot of confusion between S9+ and Pixel 2XL, finally decided to buy Pixel2 XL because of the native Android experience. \n\nPros:\n1.Pixel2 XL gives a buttery smooth android experience, (zero lag, fast switching between apps, super fast browsing)\n2.It's camera is quite amazing. In all ligting conditions it manages to produce sharp and clean images I am taking lot more photos these days after using pixel. The portrait mode works good.\n3.Even after playing real racing/dead trigger2 it doesn't heat much, so the thermal management in Pixel2 XL is quite good.\n4.Pixel2 XL has great battery life.\n5.Finger print sensor is super fast, I am really surprised with the accuracy and the speed of this sensor.\n6.Pixel2 XL has stronger signal reception capability. In my previous phone(one plus) I hardly use to get 4G  signals.\n7.Stereo speakers are awesome. The clarity, loudness, positions of the speakers is just perfect.\n8.As everyone knows unlimited storage and 3 years software updates.\n\n\nCons:\n1.Display is not as great as Samsung's super amoled type but it's not bad though I am happy with it except the blue shift which I am used after a day of usage.\n2.Headset jack removal is annoying, the type-c to 3.5mm Adaptor they provided does not work. Need to spend extra money to get a good quality wireless headset. Also the Type-C headsets are not yet available in India from too many manufacturers if u wish to buy one.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "19 Mar, 2018", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},
{"rating": 1, "title": "Flipkart needs to up its game", "review": "This is for Flipkart and the offer zone. The Google mobiles available on offer have an extremely old manufacture date specially for pixel 2xl of which the old models had screen defect. \nSecondly the service on Flipkart is horrible, terrible service. Even smaller sites have better service than Flipkart.. They don't care if you get a defective piece. You don't get any replacement for the same. Every website gives that surety. I got this phone from Flipkart because of their 10 day replacement policy, that's a lie. No replacement on phones.\nThe piece I got is manufactured in November. It has an extreme blue tint. The entire display is so grainy, pics look pixelated on this display. It seems like a matte screen guard is appled on it. It has a dead pixel as well. Ideally this phone should be replaced as it's defective. Any website would do that for me. But Flipkart is the last place I am ever going to purchase anything from.

Pixel 2 XL is the current Google flagship and offers best of the Google's AI and software refinements along with a well engineered hardware.\nPros:\n1. Camera : Takes perfect shot in auto mode and the potrait mode on both sides is coming great  Makes me feel less nervous about traveling without my DSLR.\n2. Performance : Very smooth and quick. Faster than OnePlus 5 and iPhone X for day to day use. RAM optimization is more important than raw amount of it.\n3. Speakers : Loud and clear sound with some depth to it. These are kind of speakers you will find on a tablet than a phone.\n4. Design : The powder coated back is grippy and allows it to be used without a case. The phone is a bit thick but the bigger battery and negligible camera bump are the pros \n5. Battery life: 1.5 days battery life, again due to software optimizations and bigger battery.\n6. Water resistant: Peace of mind while using at pool parties or at sea side\nCons:\n1. Display: The wannabe bezeless look isn't at par with the Note 8 or iPhone X but you have to fit those speakers somewhere. The saturation issue is fixed by the first update that I got out of the box \n2. No 3.5mm jack: Not a major issue for me as I use Bluetooth earphones but the phone is chunky enough to have space for one.\n\nBottom line: Best of Android and arguably the best phone.\nIt was a no brainier for me as I got it for 45.7k after exchanging my OnePlus 3.
