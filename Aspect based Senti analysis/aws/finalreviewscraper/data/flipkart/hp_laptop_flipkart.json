I am very disappointed because after getting the laptop when I have switched it on the for the first time. It was showing a black blank screen on the display instead of options, or boot screen. I wrote to Flipkart for help and raised a ticket for the same. Flipkart people said they can't replace it and instead arranged for a service. The service engineer was not even courteous to pay a visit to my location, instead he chose to call me over the phone. And after the initial discussion, he just closed the case from his end. So I called again and the same process repeated. In the end, I had to take it to a service center at my expense to get it rectified. Flipkart didn't even help me with the product service/replacement even after repeated complaints, so I lost my time, effort and money which I could have saved if I had purchased the same from other shopping  site.
