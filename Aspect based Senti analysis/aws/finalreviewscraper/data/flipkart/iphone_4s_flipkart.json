Doesn't\u200b support fast charging, but charges 100% in less than one hr\n6. Eventhough the screen is small, doesn't feel so, while watching videos u love the quality.\n7. Compactness and one hand usage is really amazing.\n\nCons\n1. Selfi cam..better in daylight, ok in low-light. But never best.\n2. Freedom in settings is missing...specially Android users will experience.\n  Other than this not much.\n\nVerdict.. very good phone for especially girls and conventional phone users...but for the techno geeks and frequently changeover believers it does not suit...the freedom njoyed by  android users is really missing....\nGo for minimum 32 gb...if u can get below 23k otherwise wait for 128 gb(which i feel unnecessary for this phone)", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "17 Jul, 2017", "reviewer": "Venkata Ramana Babu Nadimpalli"},

Got rose gold model in Rs 15179 after exchange with Lenovo K4 note. I become bored with large screens that's why I took this phone with one hand operation. And it is genuine brand new I phone SE. You can actually believe flip kart in providing value for money product. Despite all negative reviews I ordered the phone and got this beast.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Mind-blowing purchase", "review": "Recieved the product well in time. Hatsoff to the FlipKart for on time delivery. Now about the phone, iPhone SE is a good choice for those who like to have a decent small phone having nice features and reliability.\nEarlier this phone was quite costly but now it is moderately priced. I got it in RS. 15200/- after getting 3 offers if Flipkart and HDFC bank card. \nAt this price phone is amazing. It's hardware is almost equal to iPhine 6s. \nProduct delivered to me was original and intact. Packing done by the FlipKart has degraded by time. But I received my phone without any damages.\nDetails on box shows that phone was imported in India in August 2107. \nMost admired features of the phone are its size and it's performance. Size is so small and performance is insanely big. I am now in a great comfort of carrying phone with me. It never bulge out from my pocket. It's performs in running applications and in general operating is decent. I always want this type of phone and now my search ends. Really it's nice to get rid of bulky phones. \nCamera is decent in all type of lighting conditions but front facing camera is not upto mark in comparison to the time where people's are selfy concious. Of taking selfies it will disappoint you. But for normal pics it is good. \nBrowsing and surfing the internet is good but reading text may strain your eyes as size of display is too small. But browsing speed and compatibility to web technologies is amazing, all the sites open smoothly.\nE-mail client is too good and you never regret of using it.\nMessaging and Calling quality is good and you hear the caller's voice clearly even in a crowded site. \nIt is is VoLTE phone you can use it with Jio Network for calling as well as data.\nBattery life is much better in comparison to other iPhones. If you are using the phone as phone not an entertaining device then it will let you enjoy full plus day. But use of multimedia may cause battery drain faster and need charging by dusk time. Battery is really better in comparison to other iPhone models.\nIt's way of notifications is way better and it is good for busy executives and more suitable to senior citizens.\nIt's operations are most easy and elderly people will be happy to use them.\nInbuilt Apple Pay and support to Apple watch, NFC is a plus feature, however ApplePay is not usable in India at this time (October 2017) may be useful in future.\nTouch ID i.e. finger print scanner is really disappointing. To unlock phone you have to scan and press the home button with your finger unlike iPhone 7 where you need to only touch the scanner.\nIt doesn't have 3-D touch. But in general it is not a required feature by now and not supported by most of the applications.\nAll other features are same of iPhone 6s and iPhone 7.\nMaps and GPS is accurate and fast. It also support Google maps.\nMy opinion about this phone is I like it and it is an excellent phone for professionals like Doctors, engineers, respected teachers and professors, advocates.\nCollege going and school students, others  who use their phone to watch movies and play games extensively please keep away of this phone as it is not meant for you.\n\nIt may be best choice for elderly persons.\nI will share my experiences after using it for 2-3 months.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "19 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "SANDEEP KUMAR"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "The best your money can buy from Apple", "review": "I have been using iPhone SE for quite a lot of time and I can tell you guys that go for it. it's the value for money Apple product and it has iOS 11 update and also it runs smoothly in anything and it takes much sharper clear images with 12 megapixel camera with 4K video Recording out of the box and  2 GB of RAM is well enough for it to handle any kind of apps and graphics intensive games. If you're trying to buy a smaller display super phone I would recommend to buy iPhone SE and don't go for the iPhone 6s if you want the biggest screen and the same features go for the 6S it comes with a bigger screen but it comes with a lot of cost too and as the display of iPhone SE smaller the processing is much much more better in any kind of daily usage. and it has  better battery and the battery longevity is much better if you charge it around like 10 PM at night and then you wake up at 8 AM in the morning you will see that 99% charge left. Reason is because better iOS optimisation and better standby time of iOS side recommend all of you to go for this phone instead of going any big phones and after using the few days you will just get better at the keyboard typing it won't bother at all. For those of you who are reading my review thanks for reading it and the whole review is written through iOS keyboard voice recognition The bit of an example ;)\ngood luck :)", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "21 Sep, 2017", "reviewer": "Snehasish Banik"},

{"rating": 4, "title": "Worth the buy if you are not into customisation.", "review": "This is basically an iPhone 6s packed in a smaller body (minus the latest fingerprint sensor and OIS for back camera, 5MP front camera and 3D touch).\n\n1- Performance is, needless to say, very good, since hardware-software integration is seamless as always.\n\n2-The primary camera gives colossal performance in daylight and good to average performance in low light. Front camera is a 1.2 MP (idk why Apple didn't upgrade it) but clicks good photos in daylight, although in low light the picture tends to get a bit grainy.\n\n3-Software is great (runs on ios 10.3.3 out of the box, can be upgraded later) and with the hardware specs similar to 6s, should still get sufficient updates.\nFingerprint sensor is a tad bit slow, but you'll get used to it (unless you are super fussy).\n\n4-With the A9 processor and the amount of RAM provided, this hardly shows any lag even in the execution of heavy games which require a lot pf 'brainwork'.\n32GB (you get around 27GB usable) is fine if you generally upload everything on social media. For people who tend to keep memories for longer, 64GB should be a better option. And for avid 4K shooters, wait for the 128GB. The option to use iCloud's 5GB is good too. \n\n5-Battery backup is not exceptional, but is good, and you'll never really find your phone out of juice with light to moderate use.\n\n6-Looks good and that aluminium body feels premium.\n\n7-As for the screen, those who are saying it is for small screen users only, my personal opinion, after using everything ranging from Samsung Champ to iphone X, is that that a mobile device should not exceed a screen size of more than 5 inches. Any bigger, it violates the term 'mobile' and more or less feels like a phablet.\nSo screen size, according to me, is perfect. You could go for iphone 6 if you need a bigger screen within a similar bracket. But then you'll be losing on a lot of upgrades.\n\n\nBasically, it is a great phone, and can satisfy the fussiest of users (who don't bicker over screen size).\n\nEDIT: After using for about a month, no major issue. But do go for a software upgrade.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "9 Jan, 2018", "reviewer": "Mohit Senapati"},
