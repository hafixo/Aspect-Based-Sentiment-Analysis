Search online for HAAC Microphones by Nokia and you will what an amazing piece of technology and  innovation its.\n\nNavigation Software,Map application.\nThe default map application in IOS 7 is the Apple's Own Apple Maps.If you don\u2019t know this remains the worst Map software among its competition which includes Google Maps(default in Android),Here(Nokia)Maps(default in all Nokia smartphones,Jolla and Kindle Android also used by 4 out of 5 cars with GPS) bing Maps ( default in non lumia Win Phones).Apple Maps has been notorious for its innacurate data which has lead people to drive straight to Airport runways.You will however get Google Maps and Here Maps in App store but Apple maps will remain as your default map app.\n\nDesign\nNothing much has change from Iphone 5 and 4S.Its allmost  same itself.\n\nScreen\nApple screen is one of the best in Market but it remains a bit small.I am not a Fan of big screen but the screen can be bumped to 4.3 which is sweet spot.\n\nProcessor.\nProcessor is Apple's proprietery A7 which gives fast performance thanks to good OS optimisation.This  is a plus when compared with Android but not so much when comparing Win Phone whose low end phones like  Lumia 520 is comparable with Galaxy S3.Being 64 bit doesn't serve any purpose as no apps are now made for 64 bit.By the time they make you will be throwing away this phone after long use.\n\nOverall\nBuying this makes little practical sense esp at this price. There are amazing products from other manufacturers which offer better phones at cheaper price. Phones like Lumia 1020,HTC One,LG G2 each of which has innovating features and DOUBLE the memory.Only truly ignorant people buys Iphones by their choice.This fact is high lighted by the high market share iPhone  enjoys in US and we know the level of ignorance  Americans have (not all Americans I mean).", "verification": {}, "date": "13 Dec, 2013", "reviewer": "Aaron Abraham N"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Fantastic Smartphone Just Buy it", "review": "Thanks to Flipkart and WS Retail.\nI replaced my 2 year old nexus 5 (32GB) phone with this iphone5S in replacement offer from flipkart. So I received this iPhone from WS Retail in Original Apple iPhone Packaging.All accessories are Brand new including iPhone Device. I crossed checked warranty of this product by entering the serial number of device and confirmed online that phone is having 1 year validity. I called to Apple iPhone customer executive and given the serial and IMEI number of device to certify authenticity of product, and got to know from Apple that received product is genuine brand new iPhone.\nI been using this iphone for last 20 days with no issues. Charger I got along with this iPhone is good,it charges the iphone to 100% in 1 hour. And I use phone moderately whole day to play music, watch videos, messaging,calling and other stuff. So battery backup comes for about 10 -11 hour. So I believe its fair and nice battery backup. Earphones of this iPhone 5s are Awesome , I am sure for every music lover it gives TOP NOTCH BEATS as in like you are inside Sound composing studio..!!. I do have have On-Ear Bose headphones and I been using Bose headphones for 2 years from now, I wanted to know you that iPhone5S  headphones are equally Superb like Bose. I know you cannot compare Bose headphone with iPHONE earphone, but I experienced beats to some extent.. like BOSE..! headphone. iPhone5S is complete product, I am completely satisfied.iPhone 5S screen is small, But Im not big fan of large screen. I believe smart phone should like perfectly handheld Smartphone So iPhone 5S serve its purpose with 5 star.. Video I shooted with this device is really good with crisp and clear 1080P HD motion picture. This smartphone has 8MP lens, Still Pics are nice with good details.As I use DSLR, I am not fan of smartphone camera since all smartphones except iPhone6S have small sensor motor which cannot capture details. Finally as you know Use and Feel of Iphones are always great. IPhone5S has Siri(Voice recognition) feature which lets you read your E-mail ,play music , navigate places and many stuffs with handsfree, and this phone takes your thumb impression to unlock ,all these features makes phone  a smartphone..!! My last word.. to all buyers that, Buying iPhone from Flipkart online, I made NO MISTAKE..!! and I'm truely Satisfied. Even if you go to Apple store and buy,you get same product by spending 3K or 4K more..!! .  I got 5K discount for exchanging my old Nexus 5(which I used for 2 years extensively) and bought iPhone 5S for 18,900/- only.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "31 Jan, 2016", "reviewer": "Sandeep Hiredesai"},
{"rating": 5, "title": "Great Product, Trusted Online Dealings", "review": "I was really looking forward to own an iPhone for last 2-3 years & Flipkart helped me to make that dream to a reality in the form of an iPhone 5S Spac-e Grey 16 GB  (Model A-1530). \n\nThis is really a stunning piece of creation & I was amazed by the kind of discounts offered by Flipkart & WS Retail for such a flagship product from Apple. \n\nThe product was safely delivered as \"manufacturer box packed iPhone\" double packed inside Flipkart's own box along with Credit Card swiping facility while taking the delivery at my doorstep (COD). \n\nAs indicated by their website, the product was 100% new & genuine &  Apple India's domestic service warranty (1Year) has started as soon as I activated my phone. Since apple products need activation using a SIM, you can make out the status by checking the activation status of its IMEI with Apple website, immediately after Flipkart prepares the invoice. \n\nThe new iCloud storage of 5GB (free with iPhone) helped me to seamlessly transfer all my contacts from my old Android phone to the new iPhone. \n\nMy overall experience for the shopping experience with Flipkart, their back end partner WS Retail & the logistics partner Ekart Logistics are Simply Superb...
