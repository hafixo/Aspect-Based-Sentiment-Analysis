I mean how does it help if I have to wait!! waiting is the issue...thats why we call.\nNow moving on to the logistics Ekart is the worst and horrible logistic provider. I am into regular online shopping and never faced any issue with the logistics partner however when I called this particular delivery agent to provide me with the product before 5 he straight away denied and said I will deliver it to your neighbour or will come tomorrow. Now as it is the product is late and you are then telling me to deliver it to my neighbour...who takes the responsbility!! pathetic pathetic delivery experience never ever going to order from flipkart!!", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "6 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},

Look and feels \nAs this phone is very minimilistic the n handling and very perfectly fits to your palm and gives a lovely accent while using and looks are dedicatedly fine and perfecttt a mobile phone to be \n2. Software and hardware :- \nSoftware you get ios 10.2 out of the box and it is even pretty well and easy tooooo to use and fast too camera is decent and fulfils a good job while in daylight it is perfectly clear and in low light toooo it gives pretty well pictures \nProcessor is too good as we can't compare it with snapdragons latest ones  but it is just a dual core processor and never lets you feel backward than other android device so go for it without any worry regarding processing or camera or display as it is stunning well \n3. Battery \nOne if the most important and mandatory component of mobile phone so this thing in case of iPhone 6 we have1810 mAh battery which have a decent life throughout the day and if you are a havy gamer then you have to charge it twice a day to peak and averagely the battery backup is stunning well \n\nAt last it is an apple phone so you have not to worry regarding the products other info and charging is still prety fast so go for it friends", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "30 Aug, 2017", "reviewer": "K.Bhupender Navodaya"},
