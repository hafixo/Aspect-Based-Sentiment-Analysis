My Apple Iphone 6s is home button is not working properly and mobile getting lot of heat if I talk just 2 minutes or use the internet.  Device also very slow.  When I called to Flipkart customer centre and told about this issue, their response is very bad and they are trying to escape,they are simply saying just contact Apple customer centre. Guys you only tell me after paying 28000 thousands rupees why I need to bear this defect product, they sold me defect product and are not ready to replace the mobile or at least their behaviour also not good and they responded with very arrogance.   Guys don't buy any product from Flipkart. If you receive proper functional product then you are lucky, if you receive defect product they are not ready to support you or assistive you, the reason is I am only the example for that.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "4 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},

So here are the pros and cons -\nPros-\nGood build \nResponsive fingerprint scanner\niPhone brand value\niOS ecosystem is very simplistic and easy to use and also very dependable with barely any crashes and bugs.\nFront camera is really good and offers great amount of detail\nRam management and speed is top notch. Phone never lags and never fails to not keep apps in memory.\nAudio via headphone jack is one of the best and yes it has a headphone jack.\nVery frequent updates.\nCONS-\nRear camera produces very dim pictures and makes the sky look very unrealistic with poor dynamic range.\nDisplay resolution is only 720P . though this won't affect your day to day usage but forget about using it with VR.\nIPS LCD display is not even close to the vivid and very good looking colors provided by AMOLED displays which most phones in this price segment use.\niOS lacks practicality in some cases . Lack of proper shortcuts etc etc\n3D touch is really a waste and you will barely even use it . It's only compatible with a very limited number of apps and also functionality is quite low.\nRear camera very bad at taking low light shots due to a f2.2 aperture.\nREASONS NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE-\nPhones in this price have AMOLED displays which is far more superior to IPS LCD found in iPhone. \nOther phones offer 1080p and above resolutions making them good to view in VR.\nOther phones have way better cameras such as the s7, one plus 3T , LG V20 ,HTC 10 etc\nSome other phones come with water resistance such as the s7 which is very useful.\nS7 also comes with wireless charging.", "verification": {}, "date": "8 Mar, 2017", "reviewer": "Sukrit Chatterji"},
