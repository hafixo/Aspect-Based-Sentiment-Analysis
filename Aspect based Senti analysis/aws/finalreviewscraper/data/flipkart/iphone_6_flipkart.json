{"rating": 4, "title": "Best Laptop for Everyday as well as High end Application.", "review": "Now it is 1 and half year from Purchase.\nPros-\nDisplay- Retina Display 2560x1600 is stunning. Even after full zooming, Image or text never becomes blur.\n\nBattery- With WIFI is on, I actually took readings and I got 9 hours 45 min of battery. Which is outstanding.\n\nTrackpad-Force Touch feels really great. Due to gestures, It becomes very easy to use trackpad.\n\nPorts- It has 1 MagSafe 2 Charging port,2 USB ports, 2 Thunderbolt ports 1 SD card ,1 3.5mm headphone and 1 HDMI. USB 3 ports are very fast. Transfer speed is good. Thunderbolt to VGA adaptor is also great. Just Due to retina display, you have to adjust resolution of projector as projectors do not support 2560x1600 resolution. MagSafe 2 charging is incredible. As it is magnetic You don't have to worry about disconnecting wire. Even though if somebody pulls wire accidentally, just wire will get disconnected and it will prevent mac from falling. Also Charging indicator on charging wire shows you battery is fully charged or not. With HDMI you can easily use your TV as display for MacBook. \n\nCamera-720p facetime camera is not too bad. Photos comes really good. for FaceTime calling, video quality is also good\n\nKeyboard- Even though it is not butterfly mechanism, typing is very good on this MacBook. For day to day typing, this keyboard is enough.\n\nConnectivity- With bluetooth, you can send as well as receive any type of file from any device. For USB also any Pen drive can be attached to mac. So You can share files from MAC to windows as well as Linux based computers.\n\nMusic- You can actually download mp3 from internet and play it on Mac. There is no any restriction like iPhone or iPad. Sound Quality is awesome.\n\nCons-\nNot useful for Gamers.\nDue to SSD is 128 GB not useful for Boot  Camp.\nMagsafe 2 port becomes dirty very soon. So charger pin does not fit well.You have to clean port regularly.\nSometimes apps stops working.\nSometimes it lags.\nBut overall good. If you really want to buy Mac then this 2015 model is really great option.", "verification": {}, "date": "21 Dec, 2016", "reviewer": "Akshay Sant"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "High-end laptop,the best Macbook ever !!", "review": "The MRP for 2016 Jan changed to 106900/-, although NO difference in Hardware SAME Product !! \n\nI absolutely love my MacBook Pro 13.3\" laptop. Writing genuine review on my overall experience. \n************************************************************************ \n\nI've used my early 2015 13\" Retina MBP pretty intensively every day. I also got 7.5% extra  - http://goo.gl/OyC5Ui via flipkart .I'm evaluating it relative to my 11\" recent-year fully loaded MB Air and the most recent non-retina MB Pro, which I used for a year at work. \nHere are my impressions of the 2015 rMBP so far, relative to these other Macbooks: \n\n* Display \nThis is the main reason I bought the rMBP and I'm absolutely thrilled with it. It blows away every other Macbook's display except of course the 15\" retina MB Pro. \n\n* Weight \nThe 13\" rMBP weighs 3.5 pounds. Whether that feels like a burden or a breeze will depend on what you're comparing it to. \n\n* Force track pad \nThe \"force\" part -- pressing the track pad harder to activate different features -- is not supported in most applications now, but more and more applications will support it in the coming year. Until that happens, it works great as a regular trackpad - better than the (already excellent) trackpad on previous MB Pros and Airs. I like using the new trackpad pretty well. But it's not a killer feature, and in the future when more apps take advantage of it it will probably be like having a third mouse button--handy, but hardly essential. \n\n* Speed & Performance \nThe 2015 rMBP has a newer generation of processor and graphics. Everything feels very fast, including bootup times, app startup, running apps, etc. That said, the 2014 model feels very fast, too, and I don't think most people will notice any speed improvements with the 2015 model over the 2014 model in normal everyday usage. \nApple claims the 2015 model's flash SSD is twice as fast as the SSD in the 2014 model. Independent testing from professional review sites have verified this. However, in normal usage, I don't notice much difference - the SSD in last year's model is pretty dang fast. \n\n* Battery life \nApple claims 10 hours to a charge, compared with 9 hours on last year's model. Independent tests by professional reviewers largely support Apple's claim: Laptopmag.com reports 12 hours 4 minutes; PCMag.com gets 11 hours 10 minutes; CNET gets a whopping 15 hours 42 minutes. \n\n \n* Summary: should you buy one? \nBuy a retina MB Pro instead of an Air if you want a MUCH better display, more connectivity, a more powerful system, and don't mind an extra 1/2 pound relative to the 13\" MB Air (or full pound relative to the 11\" Air). \n\nIf you choose the 13\" retina MBP, I'd encourage you to shop around for good deals on last year's model. It has the same excellent screen, keyboard, design, and same exact weight and dimensions. The 2014 model doesn't have the new force trackpad, but I think most people can easily live without this. The new 2015 model is slightly faster, but I think most people won't notice the differences in every day usage--I wouldn't. If you can save $300 by getting last year's model, that seems like a no-brainer to me. I didn't do it because I'm a teacher, and with my education discount at the Apple online store I got a 2015 model for about the same price as the best deal I could find on last year's model.", "verification": {}, "date": "26 Jan, 2016", "reviewer": "Geeta Singh"},

And above all this do i need to say anything about the Retina Display, Everyone Knows about it, and if you don't then Google about it . \nIf you have also been a loyal windows user ,like me then believe the price you pay is worth .\nI purchased it from Chroma(Tata)  and Not from flipkart for  about 90K .If you are planning to Buy it for Gaming then go for Alienwares ,This is Not for you .Macs are made for performance accordingly with their pricing.Go for this one If you have budget \nAround 60k to 80K.", "verification": {}, "date": "1 May, 2015", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},
