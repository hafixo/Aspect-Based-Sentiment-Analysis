The camera has an awesome shutter speed which is good for clicking pics of Notes very fast.. lol, thus it servers my Purpose \n- Excellent Voice assistant Siri.\nCons \n- Not recommended for Heavy Multimedia lovers, they can Go for for 6s plus, as 6s screen is a bit small. \n- Certain small tweaks are absent which were important. For eg Call recording and Vibration alert when the call is connected so u have to stick it to your ears.\n-No fast charging.\n-Can't access all the files.\nAs an Android user I could store any type of file on my phone. .rar .zip .exe any format of file could me stored and accessed when ever needed. \nBut on an I phone u can Store and Access only Pics Mp3s Videos Pdfs and other .doc files. Other than that u can't access all other file types from files from a file manger. \n- Has an Higher level of SAR as compared to other smart phones.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "3 Jun, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Great product", "review": "I was a bit skeptical before ordering an iphone online because i have seen many negative reviews about people getting damaged products or fake products. So i sent a mail as a pre-order enquiry to Flipkart. They have assured me that i will be receiving a genuine product. So i just ordered an iphone 6s 32gb and i received it today. I request buyers to make a video while unboxing the product so that they would have a proof if the product turns out to be fake. I got an original product from Flipkart and im thankful to them for that and for making it available at such a low price compared to retail market.\n\nNow coming to the phone itself, what can i say.... its an iphone after all l. No company can match apple's build quality and after sales support.\nEverything is great about this mini beast. The one thing that attracted me towards this phone is its form factor. It feels great in hand.\nCamera is great.... ram management is superb..... display is comparable to other Android flagships but will not match amoled screens..... the storage u get out of the box is around 22gb so keep that in mind.... havent installed any high end games yet but im sure that it can run any game smoothly as i have seen in all the reviews.\nSwitching from Android to ios is a bit of a hassle. I have been an Android user for the past 4 years and i think that if u want ios like optimization then only Google's nexus and currently pixel devices offer that. But i didnt get a pixel because the after sales service is poor. Hopefully the next pixel comes with collaboration of LG rather than HTC.\n\nIn this price range there are only 2 good devices and they are oneplus 5 and iphone 6s.\nIf u want a larger screen then go for oneplus5 or else i would recommend iphone 6s... it is a great device overall and im loving every bit of using it.\n\nJust go for it u won't regret ur choice!!!", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "29 Jun, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},

Gives so rich look to ur pictures \n4K video recording is also good \nOnly thing that lacks is optimal image stablization. \nSo if u are running while recording a video it may not be stable and may give u blurr or low iso pictures ! \nBut anyone who is confused between buying an iphone 6s what are u waiting for ? \nGo for it . \nBest phone u can have even after its 3 years of releasing.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "10 Feb, 2018", "reviewer": "Anurag Bhoir"},

Well the iphone 6s is a remarkable smartphone by apple. Was introduced in 2015 but still outperforms many flagships of this year too.\nNow coming to Pros:\n1. Performance: No lag at all. Use any application and it just flows easily.\n2. IOS: Sweet, simple and intuitive. Great animations and great user interface.\n3. Camera: Iphone is still one of the fastest pic capturing camera in any light. Flawless pics in any light source.\n\nNow coming to some cons:\n1. Less functionalities: IOS has some user restrictions like no external downloading from internet. Still some apps can be used. Music can be downloaded via wynk music or savnn but can't be just added from computer. You got to use itunes for that which is a bit lenghty process.\n2.Battery: Some might say battery life of iphone is very less but for my use it is just enough for the day.\n3.Other features like Dual sim and microsd slot are missing.\nOverall a great phone to buy if you have to use for a year or more and you are ok with one sim only.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "9 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Vijayant Malik"},
