{"rating": 5, "title": "Excellent phone", "review": "Excellent phone and received it in perfect condition before delivery date.. Satisfied with the product, seller and Flipkart's delivery service. \nPROS:\nExcellent display in 1080p resolution which makes pictures, videos appear crystal clear. Playing 1080p and 4K videos is a great fun on iPhone 6S plus. \n\nGreat camera.. I liked its Panorama pictures, 1080p 30fps/60fps and 4K 30fps videos the most. \n\nGood battery backup.. 2750mAh battery managed to run the phone for 5-6 days with normal usage on single charge..However I disagree with Apple's official website info that music playback duration on single charge is 80hrs but I do agree to the fact that the standby time of this phone is 16 days which is in accordance with Apple's claim.. That means on a single charge upto 100%, the phone can run upto 16 days or even slightly more than that if u r not using it... Battery backup is obviously much better than Android phones but equivalent to Windows Phones.. \n\nGreat OS.. Right out of box the phone came with iOS 10.2 and it's very easy to use unlike Windows... I have used all the 3 platforms (Android, Windows and now iOS ) and trust me I found iOS to be the easiest and user friendly after Android... U will only face little bit problem while importing and exporting pictures, videos and music but again iTunes and iCloud make the task easier... I didn't face any problem while setting up my new phone and making it ready with music, apps, videos and some digital camera pics within 3 hours only whereas it took me about half a day to set up my Nokia Lumia 630 back in 2014... The most important feature of iOS is it's secured and lag free. But be ready with a nano SIM card as the setup process phone won't proceed further and u won't be able to use it if u don't put a SIM card in the slot.... And once the phone is completely set up, u can remove the SIM card and use it.\n \nExcellent earphone and music.... The earphone of Apple i.e the Earpod is an excellent accessory and produces good quality music with rich sound and decent bass... U need not listen to music with full volume as it produces loud  music even at 50%-60% of the volume level which is enough.... Samsung's earphones also perform very well with iPhone.. But do put ur Earpods in the box provided as a precaution to avoid it from damaging which can make u pay 2.2k-2.5k for another Earpod.. :p :) \n\n32GB is enough for me as I have only basic apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, Prisma installed on the phone... in addition to that i have 3.3GB of full HD videos, 1.6 GB of music and 500 MB of digital camera pics and still I have approx. 15.8 GB of space left which I think is enough to put up some more apps, pics and videos.. \n\nCONS:\nSpeaker sound is average as it has got only single speaker unlike iPhone SE and iPhone 7...Still it's loud enough and not a problem for me as I prefer earphones to speakers for listening to music. \n\n720p recording is average... I was not at all satisfied with the clarity 720p 30fps and 240fps slow motion recording. Though the slow motion video is good enough but the clarity is little bit compromised.. My Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro and even my Nokia Lumia 630 record 720p video better or same as this... But the 1080p 30/60fps and 4K 30fps video of iPhone is unbeatable...", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "11 Jun, 2017", "reviewer": "Debashis Jena"},
