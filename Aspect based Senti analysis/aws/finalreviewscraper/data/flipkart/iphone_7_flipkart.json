It's worth spending every single Rs on this. \nThis is my short review, i will come back and update once i have enough experience on this.\n\nApart from good specifications others would have explained in detail, my quick pros and cons are below:\n\nPros:\n1) Beautiful display, sometimes you would just like to keep looking at it :)\n2) Good battery life. Once you charge 100%, it will last for almost a day. Also charges 100% in almost 3.5 hrs.\n3) Camera: Amazing picture quality and depth. No question about dual camera.\n4) Performance: Very quick response time, with app opening, unlocking the phone etc.\n\n\nCons:\nNot anything major. I get blurred images if subjects move.
