{"rating": 5, "title": "Just wow!", "review": "I previously had iPhone 6S and am pretty happy with the new iPhone. I am listing the pros and cons I found for others to consider before purchase:\nPros:\n1) Camera quality - much more sharp, better quality and specially low light photography has improved. Also  OIS (welcome feature for us coming from 6S) which was included from 7 - helps take better video and zoom photos\n2) Internal Phone Speaker sound quality much improved over 6S\n3) Processing speed - noticeably fast compared to 6S in day to day activities and for games its better than iPhone 7 \n4)  Better AR support with new Bionic chip\n5) New Gold color (some of you folks might not find it to your taste but I like it!!)\n6) Waterproof and Dustproof (not supported in 6S)\n7) Better Bluetooth (5.0 supported from 4.2 in 6S) which has better range and higher speed - Apple watch and bluetooth speakers works better\n8) Capable of Wireless Charging (Qi Standard) and Fast charging (not present in 6S). No problem of simultaneously listening to songs and charging that iPhone 7 users complain due to removal of headphone jack\n9) All other things you love about 6S are mostly intact like Touch ID\nMy most important improvement - Improved Battery life due to better efficiency of processors - you get at least 2 hrs over 6S with similar usage\n\nCons\n1) Same design principle as 6S\n2) No dual camera still - and no potrait mode support like Plus series\n3) Screen size not improved having same Bezels like 6S - unlike newer Samsung Models or iPhone X\n4) No fast charging cable or adapter - need to buy separately \n5) Wireless charging speed - currently throttled to 5W which is slow- expected to be increased to 7.5W with next IOS update but still half of what some Android phone offers\n6) Price - there is no point complaining because Apple charges premium for the experience and brand - so hate it if you want but you have no option but to wait for better deals at online (like I received at Flipkart)\n7) All Glass makes it a bit more fragile compared to 6S and 7\n\nNeutral:\nHeadphone Jack - really not sure if I hate it or love it - frankly not making much of a difference for me due to improved battery life from 6S and the inclusion of lightning supported headphone jack with the box. Also if you want you can invest in Wireless headsets.\nTrue Tone - Not making much difference to me - you had the option to turn on 'night shift' anyways in 6S\nWider color gamut support - improved color reproduction but nothing noticeable\n\n\nBetween Apple and Android - I personally prefer ios due to transparency in keeping my data safe and not selling them to advertisers and as a principle not monitoring me without my consent. Also I have invested in iPad, Watch and Macbook and things work together seamlessly to provide an enriching experience - so if you own more products from Apple other than iPhone then do not think of switching - you will never get that wholistic experience with Google and Microsoft combined (though individually Google and Microsoft are pretty good in their own respective areas - Phones and PCs). For others take your pick - Apple or Google for Phones and Apple or Microsoft for PCs depending upon your preferences!\n\nAs far as Flipkart goes for Delivery - simply fantastic work guys - love the professionalism shown in delivery compared to closest competitors. Few things which makes the delivery experience wonderful are listed below:\n1) Delivery on time - tracking updates very precise with details - competitors sometimes miss timelines even if you are paid customers\n2) Number shared of Wishmaster is reachable unlike some competitors where the phone numbers are either not shared or even if shared they are not reachable or goes unanswered\n3) Great packaging - here not much of a difference", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "13 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Kaustav Ghosh"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Great Upgrade only if you own a iphone 6 or earlier versions", "review": "iphone 8 is a great upgrade over iphone 6 or previous versions. I like the product personally. \nHowever I would say if you are not a power user and have an iphone 6s or 7 etc, I feel there is no need to upgrade just yet, unless you really want this ;)\nThis is one of the most powerful phones out there, and it matches or beats most of its competition with a high-quality camera. You can feel the difference over its predecessors when you start playing games in A.R etc. Apple say's that this processor is comparable to the macbook air!!", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "3 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Prineel Bandellu"},
