They had to deliver on Monday and the seller didnt even ship it until Monday. Then it was in Flipkart Bangalore hub for 22 hours before it was shipped to Delhi. It took another 24 hours for it to reach Delhi and then it was out for delivery on Thursday. I was not in town, so it was re-scheduled for Monday. In between Thursday and Monday I received numerous calls and emails from Flipkart asking me to cancel the order or get it delivered to someone else at the address. I told those fools that I had taken the exchange offer and dont they want the old phone? Finally, the day came and the delivery guy called up at least 5 times before reaching the delivery address as he was new to the area. He checked the phone details IMEI number etc and took the phone. He called me back at 9pm saying that he cannot check the IMEI and asked me to Whatsapp the screenshot I had shown him during the visit. Terrible!

{"rating": 5, "title": "Finally a refreshed iPhone experience in years!!", "review": "The phone reached me as promised on the launch day by flipkart. So full marks to flipkart for speedy delivery. \n\nAs far as the phone is concerned, I would say its a great phone. I have been an iPhone user since the time of iPhone 4 and have bought every iPhone since then. This time Apple has bought something new as compared to the iPhones in the past. \nThe iterations of iPhones were becoming boring and no revolutionary feature was being added by the company, iPhone X definitely changes it. So its  not a boring iPhone like the other ones.\n\nStarting with my experience:\n\nThe display is the main highlight here. Its sharp and gorgeous to look at. You will definitely be happy with it. The chin on top is unnoticeable after few minutes of using the phone.\n\nThe battery life is insane. Heavy users can expect a full day battery and for light users, it can last upto 2 days! Its  Definitely better than iPhone 8 plus for that matter.\n\nFaceId also works really well and I dont miss the TouchId. \n\nPerformance is brisk without any lag as expected. No issues there\n\nCamera performance is also great, especially the new studio light effects and front camera portrait mode feature! I would say you wont Be disappointed from the camera of this phone. Although its similar to the camera of iPhone 8 plus upto a large extent. \n\nFinally to conclude in brief, overall iPhone X is a great phone. The only issue is: Price of the phone is on a higher side which could have been much less in my opinion(compared to the pricing in other countries). Otherwise its the phone to buy, instead of the iPhone 8 or 8 plus if you want to upgrade from older iPhones or if you just dont want a boring old iPhone platform. I think it is worth it over the iPhone 8 plus at least.\nI hope this short review helps you in deciding your purchase of this device. Cheers!!\nP.S: Go for the silver colour. I think it pops more.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Early Impressions of World's Most Awaited Device - iPhone X", "review": "Okay, so here it is... iPhone X (it's 10 - TEN and not 'Ex' or 'X'). Before I jump to iPhone X, let me quickly comment on Flipkart's service. They delivered before the date committed (6th Nov was scheduled date whereas product received on 5th Nov itself). While delivery was scheduled for 6th Nov, fans/early adopters do expect launch day delivery and thus it would be appreciated if Flipkart can plan the same accordingly to reach all the pre-order on launch day or a day later than 2 days+. Also, the customer care team is trained to give you rhetorical answers and that can be improved.\n\nAlright, coming back to business, iPhone X is definitely a few years ahead of the competition. The Face ID is so damn good, accurate and reliable. Works like magic. The front notch doesn't bother me and new gestures become familiar in just a few hrs as the base of iOS remains same. The camera is so damn good, that people would want you to click their pictures to be used for display pics on social media. The Design is amazing and feels premium. The glass and steel just combine edge to edge to give you a singular unibody design. Super Retina Display is so damn amazing, the contrast ratio is far far far better than previous iPhone and the black is so deep that it gives you color perfection while looking at it. Am still getting used to the True Tone display, however, you do have a facility to turn the same off. The Processor is so fast, you don't even have to wait for apps to load anymore. Even last year's iPhone (7 series) feels slower in front of A11 Bionic Processor. \n\nAm keeping this really short. If you want it, can afford it, just go for it, cause you don't know if there is a better tomorrow.
