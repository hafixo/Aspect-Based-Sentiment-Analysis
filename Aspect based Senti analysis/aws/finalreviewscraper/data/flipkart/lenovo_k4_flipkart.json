{"rating": 4, "title": "A straight and honest review and detailed comp with 3s prime", "review": "without waiting time i'll tell u what t's worth then decision is up to u...\nassuming u already read the description and features lets go to performance \n3 gb ram out of 1.2 is free for flawless usage... didn't had any hanging or rebooting issue with this one, i'm a heavy user,as my data is on 24/7 and my all social and the apps are always running in background  i  still get a whole day of non stop processing i.e, battery backup is good but not as grate as xiomi redmi 3s prime it's bcz of the screen resolution k6 power wields 1080ppi screen where as 3s prime has  720ppi. and over that 3s prime has 100MAh extra battery.. so i have used both alternately i have both of em so i'm honest here... 3s prime is about half a day more lasting than k6  power.\nboth the phones have same hardware and on board features so there is no difference in performance... let me rank them,\n1. Gaming, both have same Adreno 505.. i played nova , modern combat,asphalt 8 and asphalt nitro, and i was freaking impressed there was not a single frame drop, not even a slightest hanging flawless and superb experience in both of them but i noticed some warm up in 3s prime while playing but not in k6 power . so for gaming i'll give 9/10 \n\n2. Battery , k6 power has 4000MAh of lithium polymer battery where as 3s prime has 4100 MAh it isn't much of a difference but  still xiomi has a lead \n\n3. Sound,, k6 power has 2 Dolby atoms rear facing speakers and 3s prime has mi louders simple.. 3s prime dosen't stand's a chance of comparison \ni use Dolby atoms in k6 power with sony head phone they realy change the experience of listing music.. without headphones the sound ok k6 power is impressive and loud with rich base and surround sound i'll give 10/10 for sound in k6 power.\n\n4. Display .. k6 power is holding a full 1080 hd  ips display where as 3s has 720pp HD.. watching movie or hd vedios on k6 power gives rich experience i'll give 8.5/10 for the display because of it's high resolution display it consumes more power..\n\n5.storage..both have 32 gb interna out of witch in k6 power's android consumes 8.01 gb and available for user is 24gb wher as in 3s prime gives 25 gb free for user  so i'll give 8/10 for storage\n\n6.design.. both of them has uni body full metal body .. but especially for me i think k6 power has a better build quality science i have seen some tear and wear on 3s prime some paint loss and some fading but k6 is holding good, i have accidentally dropped it  once or twice too but had no issue.\nk6 power is a tad thicker and bulkier than 3s prime but weights same in hand and usage but i like the hold of k6 power, but it has some round edges which makes the phone slippery as a soap so u have to be careful with that bcz none have the glass protection so investing on screen protecter will be a good precaution..i'll give 9/10 for looks and build quality  \n\n7. ''CHARGING'' now guy's do read this one carefully bcz there is a twist that will make u re think again before purchasing..\nwhile charging both the phone take around 2.30 to 3 hours to full charge from 0-100 as both of the comes with 5.2v 2 amps charger but-but-but \nwhile charging lenovo k6 power heats up like a hot plate u can defiantly cook an omelet for free of cost LOL the highest temp while charging was recorded 48.7 d's this is a major problem with this phone,. and u should know heating is the biggest enemy of battery bcz of heating battery looses it's backup power and eventually it will reduce it's performance too so consider this as a good advice and use a 1.2 amp charger it'll take some time to charge but will ensure your product's long and healthy life i tested and use a moto 1.2 amp charger it work's grate and doest not heat's the devie while charging and backup is also good .. but it does not heats up while heavy usage it becomes warm just a little like arround 38 d's that's common... but with xiomi it dosen't heat's much while charging but sure does when heavy used. \n \nNO doubt k6 power is the best supper phone for 8999, but it has it's own problem like over heating while charging despite of that u get 1080ppi of full hd screen and doubly atoms, build quality and looks of k6 power is better than 3s prime  \n\nso now u know every thing about k6 and it's rival 3s prime .... now decision is yours to make... so  now which one will u chose.\n\ni'll personally suggest u to go for k6 power bcs it has more features and better build quality than it's rivals  it's worth every single rupee.\n hit like if u find it use full and vise-versa... thank you for reading", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "18 Apr, 2017", "reviewer": "Abhishek Madhusudhan"},

Lenovo removed unnecessary apps and general perfomance is good and you can also uninstall remaining useless apps also, which is a good thing.\n\nFingerprint sensor is super fast, performance is smooth.\n\nStorage - Out of 32 GB, 24 GB is free at the time of first boot. Ram is free around 1.6 GB for first time out of 3 GB.\n\nHybrid Slot- You can use 2 Sim only or 1 Sim+ 1 micro sd, not 2 Sim+ micro sd at a time. So if you want all three slots working at the same time, Don't purchase it. \n\nCamera is good or above average, on par with Redmi 3s prime, low light photography is average at its best. If you want mainly a camera phone, you may be disappointed.\nBuy Honor 8 or something like that but you have to spend a lot of money for a good camera phone.\n\nBattery life is very good with full HD display.\n\nDisplay- Display is good colors are sharp and near accurate but Brightness is somewhat average but that is not problem for me because I prefer Battery life.   \n\nJio 4G- I have been using it along with aitel, and network reception is good.\n           Speed of net largely depends upon the area you live and network coverage,     and Now a days Jio network speed is drastically decreased as the number of people is increased, but call quality is good for me.\n    \nGaming perfomance is good but ram fills up quickly, lenovo must notice this problem and give a update to its users.\nSo Gaming on redmi 3s prime > lenovo k6 power because of its HD display as compared to Full HD display of this, I am talking about higher frame rates (smoothness).\n\n\nand at last I gave a overall rating- 4.5/5.\n\nIf you don't want to buy Xiaomi Redmi 3s prime, then surely buy this. \nFlipkart services is good, but I don't get the offer on Moto Pulse 2 headphones so flipkart don't do false ads.\nAnd please hit the like button.\nI hope this review may be helpful for many buyers who want to buy this on next sale.\nThanks for reading.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "9 Dec, 2016", "reviewer": "Abhishek Maurya"},

I usually only like to appreciate things.\nHowever, 2 unexpected inconvenient situations faced.\n\n1. This phone was ordered from the flash sale. Even though I managed to get one and get it delivered on time, I found that there were some hardware issues. Even the product description wasn't explicit about 2nd SIM slot being only usable for SIM or Memory Card. \"Hybrid\" slot that was mentioned in the description could also mean that the slot is designed in such a way that both Nano SIM as well as Memory card can be used together. Anyhow, giving them the benefit of doubt, I went ahead only to find out that the fingerprint scanner has some hardware issue. Sometimes it detected the fingerprint other times it doesn't. Even the Jeeves technician checked it.\n\n2. When I asked Flipkart for refund as I thought K4 note is much better than K6 Power and my wife has been using it for last 1+ years, Flipkart said we can only replace and not refund. I had a similar experience with Amazon but I must explicitly mention that Amazon did not argue or debate about it. I asked for refund and they processed it.

It is possible for one or two pieces from a large scale manufacturing batch to be defective. Fortunately, I didn't receive any defective piece. So, the review is only about the phone without any hard feelings. I don't have time to play games. So, no comments on games. Do not waste time expecting to read about gaming).\n\nUser Interface/Experience: Mostly stock experience of Android. No non-sense UI. It's neat, uncluttered, organised and easy to use. EXCELLENT - 10/10.\nDisplay: Stunning resolution. Excellent for reading text. The rendering of font is brilliant. Screen is sharper. EXCELLENT - 10/10\nVideos: Very good resolution. I just felt while the colours are rendering there is a bit saturation. 9.5/10. VERY GOOD - 9.5/10\nAudio: I use Sennheiser CX 300 II in ear phones which is one of the world's best ear phones. The stock ear phones are useless and I never use stock ear phones in my life. So, my experience may be definitely better. I also suggest to buy a good ear phone always.  Dolby quality is for real and certainly a differentiating factor. It enhances the \"feel\" of the audio especially at max volume. Bass is excellent on the phone. Singers voice when I hear melodies sound slightly sharper. But the same sounds normal without Dolby. Overall, I still rate Dolby effect on the phone is for \"real\" and very impressive. OUTSTANDING - 10/10. \nTouch Experience, Hardware, Speed etc: Very effective, quick, very negligible lag noticed when too many apps opened, no hangs noticed. EXCELLENT 9.75/10.\nCamera: It's difficult to understand without posting actual images. So, I just rate directly. EXCELLENT 9.5/10. \nGaming: No comments.\nWeight,Size: Handy, sufficiently gripping. EXCELLENT 10/10\nFinger Print scanner: Very fast and efficient. EXCELLENT 10/10\nBuild Quality: Sturdy. EXCELLENT 9.75/10\n\nFinale: I especially fell in love with 'outstanding' Audio quality and if you listen to songs often, think no further. I rate this phone slightly better than Redmi 3s Prime for it's audio and video quality. \n\nOverall Recommendation: BUY.\n\nDon't forget to like/dislike the review.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Brilliant", "review": "First of all, it is a great product within 10k. I am really loving it. I am writing this review after a week use, here are my opinion on its different components :-\n\nDisplay - Probably the best thing about the product. It is simply amazing. Even redmi cannot compete with it in terms of display. Its resolution 1920\u00d71080 really outclasses any other products in this price range. 5/5 for display.\n\nBattery - 4.5/5 , While it might not be the best but it is pretty good. I myself play heavy games all day and i am a heavy user, for me it lasts a whole day, maybe 1 1/2 day. Even if you play heavy games for 8 hours a day, you will still find yourself charging the phone maximum once per day. So battery is pretty good.\n\nCharging - I would rate it 4/5. I have noticed that it takes an average 3 hours to charge from 5% to 100%. One thing i liked very much is it doesnt heat up much during charging unlike mi phones which becomes almost a gas stove while charging.\n\nProcessor speed - 5/5 , great job on it. No lags expirienced. I have even played games like fifa 14, fifa 16, gta san andreas on full graphic settings and there was not a single lag. Love the gaming expirience.\n\nRam - Again as above the games were played smoothly. Also you will find about 1.5 GB ram free even after loading your phone with lots of apps which pretty good. 5/5 for it.\n\nStorage - Again another great thing of this model. A storage of 32 GB from which you get 24 GB free is pretty big enough in my opinion at least keeping the price in mind. 4.5/5 for it.\n\nCamera - I found it way better than redmi 4 or redmi 3s prime camera. Its rear camera is way better. Even a 5 year old can tell the difference just by seeing it. Coming to the front camera, 8MP is just too good for some cool selfies. I am impressed with the quality. 5/5 for it.\n\nSpeakers - Mind blowing 5/5. Dolby atoms speakers totally rock. You might not get the difference just like that but compare it with another phone like redmi 4 or redmi 3s prime and you will see the difference. Totally love it.\n\nThats it for now. If you are looking for a good display and camera, just go for it, totally worth it for this price.\n\nIf you agree with me, please leave a like.\nDon't agree? Feel free to dislike. \nThanks and have a good day!", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "16 Jul, 2017", "reviewer": "Sanjoy  Sen"},
