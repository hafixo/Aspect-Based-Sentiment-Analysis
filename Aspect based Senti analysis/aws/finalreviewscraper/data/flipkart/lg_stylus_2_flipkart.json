One good thing is that it is completely made in India, but still reflects quality. The stylus experience is good, we could scribble notes even in off screen mode, Camera is good, the phone is light weight and looks premium. The battery could have been better.  The specs are good there is no lag or haggling at any point of time. Nano Sims dual, fast charging, good display. Overall an excellent experience no doubt.
