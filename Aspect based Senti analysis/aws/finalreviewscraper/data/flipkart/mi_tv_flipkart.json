{"rating": 4, "title": "Worth 40K Every Bit", "review": "Excellent service from Flipkart in terms of delivery within 24 hrs of purchase and Installation from Jeeves within 24 hrs from Delivery.\n\nTV looks stunning. It is ultra slim and the display is great. You will enjoy 4k and HD content very well on this TV at the same time you will hate to watch SD content from the DTH services. So better opt for HD channels if you buy this TV.\n\nSound output on TV speakers is not all that great. Tried all different settings but could not find the optimal sound experience. However it is not so bad either. I can live with it. I mostly watch movies by connecting my JBL Everest BT headphones, so that helps me. There is no lag on Bluetooth.\n\nPatchwall is a mixed experience. I feel it is more of a gimmick. There are only 4 apps pre-installed, SonyLiv, Voot kids, Hungama and Alt Balaji. There is also you tube with has been sideloaded already. I have sideloaded opera browser which works excellent. The STB integration using IR blaster does not work well all the time with Videocon D2h. I greatly miss Prime video TV app. Hope MItv gets it soon as an update.\n\nMi Bluetooth remote is also good with minimal buttons. However within some apps it becomes difficult to manage with those fewer buttons. You will feel the need for more. I found a fix for this. The best feature I found is the MI Remote Android app. Install the app in your android smartphone and it works over WiFi network. You can use the MI Remote app to control your TV. Best part is you rotate your phone and the TV content will be mirrored on your phone screen. You can then use your smartphone as a touchscreen device for your TV. Use it to know it. Excellent feature.\n\nOverall I am satisfied with the buy. Thanks Mi for the excellent product and Flipkart for the great service!\n\nCheers!\nAR", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "27 Feb, 2018", "reviewer": "Aqib Rahman"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Reviewing after a month to highlight a few key points....", "review": "This is my review after using the TV for a month. Don't want to elaborate much about basic stuff already reviewed by others. Will highlight a couple of key points not said by others.\n\nGot this TV on the very first sale and the installation happened the very next day, But I  took my time to compare this with my Samsung Full HD 3D TV which I'm using since the past 5 years.\n\nThis is an EDGE-LIT LED TV and the backlight is not distributed evenly and you can surely make this out when the room is completely dark. Coming to the clarity as said by others is very good with good color reproduction, But it lags in contrast and dimming as with other high end televisions. The screen is not able to adjust the backlight at different points as with the micro dimming feature in SAMSUNG.\n\nAnd the next thing is the sound clarity which is good but lacks in Treble and Bass. The speakers are designed only to watch the normal cable television channels and not for Dolby audio.\n\nConnecting external speakers to it is difficult as the regular 3.5mm Audio out port is missing.  You can connect an external speaker by two options. One is with Bluetooth, But you'll face an audio lag. The second option is to use a HDMI audio extractor which can be connected to the HDMI ARC(Audio return channel) port at the back. This is not available with MI and has to be sourced from third party.\n\nComing to the conclusion. If this is you're first big television, Then you'll find the picture clarity amazing. But if you've already used other brands like SAMSUNG, SONY or LG, Then you'll find the picture clarity much better in these with Full HD than the 4K clarity in MI. The normal FHD to 4K upscaling is not good and blurs the picture. You can get a crisp picture only with 4K HDR. As said by others this is only a budget TV and you'll definitely feel it's worth for the money spent.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "16 Mar, 2018", "reviewer": "Santosh N"},

{"rating": 3, "title": "MI TV 4 High on Expectations Low on Practicality", "review": "Practical problems with MI TV 4:\n\nBought MI TV 4 on first day of sale. It got delivered and installed in a day...phew that was fast. This excitement lasts only till the TV is lit up and \"patchwall\" welcome screen came on. After this point I hate to call it a smart tv. Reason: It only has Sonly Liv, Hungama Play and Voot pre-installed on it. Largely the content (note: latest) that I intend to watch on Hungama Play was available on rental of Rs.70 to Rs.120 (range) for 3 days; rental model in 2018 Seriously!! Sony Liv has least interesting content among the 3 and content is open to access for first 6 months (free subscription). Popular video platforms are not pre-installed.\n\nWhen wall mounted, side loading via pen drive or to that matter connecting any cord to the Gigantic TV is not at all possible. There is hardly any space and visibility between wall and TV panel to attach the cords. Given the thinness of the panel, it looks very delicate to demount it from the wall.\n\nXiaomi India, if you are reading this, request you to shout out to your fans regarding your plans to get more content for MI TV 4. I have been using and advocating about your mobiles for past 3 to 4 years. As a fan, my benchmark for this TV was higher in terms of practicality.\n\nWho can possibly buy this TV?\nThose who know side loading the apps on TV and this can help maximize the experience.\nPeople with loads of 4K / HD content. Given the size of display, regular content does not look good and this set is just not made for regular content.\nThose who intend to use TV as table top. That way you have complete and safe access to ports for connecting content sources.\nThose who live in a owned house or those who do not often shift from a rented accommodation.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Really Nice", "review": "The delivery and installation were very quick - Great delivery & installation experience.\n\nThe TV display & audio quality is very good at this price point.\n\nSome of the (software) issues I faced so far:\n- The IR blaster didn't work with my latest Airtel Internet TV set top box (perhaps my STB doesn't support IR, I couldn't find clear documentation). It works via HDMI CEC to control channels on STB (prev/next only as there are no numbers on MI TV remote), but then I can't use the Sensy remote application in CEC mode. So I gave up on integrated remote for my STB. This seems like an issue that could be fixed in software - My Airtel Internet TV STB has Bluetooth remote. So if MI TV remote can intelligently pair between the TV & STB, this can be made to work.\n\n- The AI recommendations are not filtered for children (no option in settings), take care when viewing with family. Initial recommendations were really vulgar content before it even built a user profile. There was no login option, so it basically started with wrong default adult profile, so I was really surprised & furious. This needs a definite software fix with option for parental controls. MI needs to understand that Phones are personal devices, and TVs in the living room are shared devices.\n\n- 3-4 seconds Beep noise when switching to a HD channel (audio decoder taking time to switch, but they didn't mute the output in the meantime)\n\n- Unpredictable delay in audio decoder. I have SPDIF optical output connected from my STB to my Home theatre (my default viewing setup). I use both TV audio (better vocals) + Home theater (Better subwoofer) simultaneously. My Airtel STB has option to control the delay between the two decoders so that user can synchronise them correctly. I could configure it once, but the delay keeps varying on MI TV between different channels / even with the same channel. This causes too much echo. I can't keep adjusting the delay between the two decoders frequently.\n\nThe software needs some time to mature.

So please read this before buy.\n\nUtter Flop Sound - You cant even watch a BlueRay movie with awesome sound. I think this is their plan to make a worse sound for selling their Home teatre. \n\nYouTube Won't play 4K:- This is another Problem. I am using 50 Mbps Broadband plan and Youtube Won't show 4K or even 2K option. Maximum support quality in Youtube is only 1080p which is worst for a 55 inch TV.\n\nSome 4K won't Play:- Some 4K videos showing lagging while playing. \n\nNo Play Store:- I tried all possible version of Play store and none of them is working.So you need to manually install the supported apps on this TV.\n\nNo Head Phone Jack:- I don't know whether it is necessary or not, but there is no Jack for plugging head phone.\n\nDifficult to access Ports if Wall mounted:- It will be very very difficult to access USB, HDMI or any ports if you have done Wall mount.\n\n\nBut This is still the best 4K TV for this price range. 4K quality is extremely good. Many are expecting 4k quality for their DTH or Cable channels Lol. If you wanna test the 4K performance, download any 4K video and run it on your TV.\n\nI hope all kind of software issues will be solved in coming patchwall update.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "11 Mar, 2018", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Fabulous!", "review": "Excellent service from Flipkart in terms of delivery and installation within 24 hours of Purchase.\n\nTV looks stunning. It is ultra slim and the display is great. You will enjoy 4k and HD content very well on this TV at the same time you will hate to watch SD content from the DTH services. So better opt for HD channels if you buy this TV.\n\nSound output on TV speakers is not all that great. Tried all different settings but could not find the optimal sound experience. However it is not so bad either. I can live with it. I mostly watch movies by connecting home theatre system or else on my MOTO PULSE ESCAPE HEADPHONES via Bluetooth.\nThere is no lag on Bluetooth.\n\nPatchwall is a mixed experience. I feel it is more of a gimmick. There are only 4 apps pre-installed, SonyLiv, Voot kids, Hungama and Alt Balaji. There is also you tube with has been sideloaded already.The STB integration using IR blaster does work well all the time with Tatasky. I greatly miss Prime video TV app. Hope MI TV gets it soon as an update.\n\nMi Bluetooth remote is also good with minimal buttons. However within some apps it becomes difficult to manage with those fewer buttons. You will feel the need for more. I found a fix for this. The best feature I found is the MI Remote Android app. Install the app in your android smartphone and it works over WiFi network. You can use the MI Remote app to control your TV. Best part is you rotate your phone and the TV content will be mirrored on your phone screen. You can then use your smartphone as a touchscreen device for your TV. Use it to know it. Excellent feature.\n\nOverall I am satisfied with the buy. Thanks Mi for the excellent product and Flipkart for the great service!\n\nDo like my review if found helpful.\n\nThanks.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "11 Mar, 2018", "reviewer": "RAJESH  SHAH "},

I found myself going back to the set top box remote more than once.\n4) if you have Amazon or Netflix membership you have to wait for an update of which the timing is obscure.The only way is to cast your laptop screen or use a HDMI cable.\n5)Content is good from Sony liv and Hungama play but regional language videos is not upto the mark.\n\nConclusion: Go for it without second thoughts.

The TV was delivered the next day and on request was installed the same day by the fantastic team over at Jeeves. Have listed the pros and cons of the TV below;\n\nPROS\nStunning design. And so thin! \n\nPicture quality is very good. It's not as crisp as the displays on the higher end tv's, but compared to my Dad's 55 inch Sony LED from three years ago, it's exactly the same! Which is saying something at this price point! \n\nThe remote of the TV looks exactly like the Fire Stick and it works wonderfully. This sort of a remote and user interface makes so much sense. The patchwall UI is designed in the same tile manner that the Amazon's fire stick is. It's a refreshingly new way to interact with your TV. \n\nCONS \nI don't have quite a problem with the inbuilt speakers as people do but yes the trebble seems boosted and the mids feel compressed. Volume isn't the problem. Quality is. \n\nLack of modern audio ports is by BIGGEST issue with this TV. No headphone jack, no optical out! It makes absolutely no sense! They have given the option to connect via Bluetooth but that usually results in an audio lag causing AV to go out sync. I really wish they had another option rather than a Coaxial connector. Home theater is lying unconnected because an optical to Coaxial converter is so hard to find. This is actually my only grouse with this TV. \n\nAll in all if you're looking for a good BIG display and have a third party entertainment streaming device (apple tv, fire stick, chrome cast etc) don't think twice!
