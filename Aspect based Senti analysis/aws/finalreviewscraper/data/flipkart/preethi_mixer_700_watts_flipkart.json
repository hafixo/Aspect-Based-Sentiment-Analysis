{"rating": 3, "title": "Not Bad", "review": "My mom bought this from a shop. This is, to be honest, not the very best. But there are some plus points too.\nPros.\n1. Good design\n2. Less space needed\n3. Less sound motor\n4. Strong blades\n5. Fast grinding\n6. Good finishing in the base unit (Main body)\n7. Super extractor is good. Dont have to get the hands wet\n8. The second most decent mixer in the market.\n\nCons\n1. Poor quality plastic in handle\n2. No finishing in jars\n3. The dome tops are funny and their gothic design that makes it looks vulgar\n4. Contents spill out with that sleak top cap. (The solution is to remove that sleak top cap      and place Dom top cap and do the wet grinding. Never spills out the contents)\n5. Grind and store is totally useless. they could have made that chutney grinding jar a bit more big.\n6. Super extractor is useless if you have a good juicer.\n\n\nPanasonic is the best mixer. But no commercials on TV, so we get a bit hesitant. Before buying the mixer, go and just window shop these both brands. You will know the difference between Panasonic and Preethi. My mom preferred Preethi Because 'Preethi is cute ...!' Preethi is feminine in looks. But those who want perfection in functioning and looks, go for the masculine Panasonic.", "verification": {}, "date": "10 Aug, 2013", "reviewer": "Stenza Augustine"},

Motor and power may be good but what is the point when you can't use it.\n\n2) Dry grinding is good.\n\n3) Super extractor is just a gimmick. All the pulp of fiber slips through bottom and get mixed with the juice. Then what is the point of trying to use it, might as well use the blender.\n\nJust 4 month old and I am already looking for replacement to it's usability.", "verification": {}, "date": "25 Feb, 2013", "reviewer": "Manish Kapoor"},
