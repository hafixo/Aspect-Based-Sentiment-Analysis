{"rating": 4, "title": "Value-for-money", "review": "First of all 5* for fk, fast delivery within 24 hrs.\nGreat, keep it up. Now come to mobile, let's see.\n(1) Display is clear & bright with fhd but tall one due to 18 :9 ratio. If you are using for first time it will take some time to adjust it, then afterwards no problem. So 9/10\n(2) Battery is great, 4000 mah is easily last for 2 days with moderate to heavy usage. So 10/10\n(3) Sound is average from speakers, not at all loud. Disappointing, actually it should have dual speakers as cost is 10k. So 7/10\n(4) Camera -- rear one with flash is average, so 8/10. Front one with selfie light ( it's not flash, first you have to on the light & then you have to click selfies ) I think it's useless. So 7/10\n(5) Led notification light is of only single white colour, again disappointing. My previous one redmi 4a have 5 to 6 colours, inspite of have cost of 6k.\n(6) Again hybrid sim slot, though knew  before \nbuying but redmi 5a have dedicated sim slot ( cost only 5k ) & note 5 with hybrid ( cost is double ) , didn't understood what's the logic behind it ???\n(7) Fingerprint sensor is fast & accurate, so 9/10\n(8) There is no problem in playing YouTube videos, it's played in full length.\n(9) It should come with latest Android ie. Oreo. But it is with Nougat. Anyway let's see when co. is giving update of Oreo.\n(10) Miui 9 is fast.\n Finally it is good budget device with 5.99\" fhd+ display with some loose point as mentioned above. Anyway co. will never give everything in one device, it's their business strategy. If my review is helpful then pls. press like button.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Simply awesome", "review": "AMAZING BALANCED PHONE - comparing to PRO version(Why i did not bought PRO an)\n1) snapdragon 636 is untested and only 1.8Ghz however 625 is 2 Ghz and widely used in past. That is the reason MI choose that processor for it. \n2) ram beyond 3gb is not needed in any apps or games in current scenario.\n3) I have stopped buying storage space even 16 gb will suffice me. I already have more than 2 tb in PC. Also not a fan of keeping lot of data in phone, it makes it slow.\n4) dual camera effect is rarely needed and can be done easily with softwares\n5) Front camera is used generally for close up pics. Whether its 20MP or 5MP it will be almost same if quality of 5 Mp is clear enough. And this phone clicks good photos from both cameras even in low light.\n6) high PPI + high CPU + gyro = Good for VR Experiance. \n7) 5G is expected in 2019 and 4g phones will be history, so dont buy for long term it will go waster. I consider this phones max life is less than 2 years for me.\n\nMy point is, of course you will get better config in PRO version BUT there is not much practical use of those features. If you dont want to use gyroscope, Redmi 5a will be better choice. Dont even bother note series.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "25 Feb, 2018", "reviewer": "Satish Sharma"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Wonderful", "review": "What a phone is this more from my expectations great phone Given the obsession of the smartphone world with the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display Xiaomi too has incorporated this for the Redmi 5 Pro. But this isn&rsquo;t the first Xiaomi phone to come with a bezel-less design in India as it had introduced this feature with its flagship device the Mi Mix 2 last year. However, with the Redmi 5 Pro, now it won&rsquo;t burn a hole in your pocket. Due to the bigger display, the capacitive keys are now on-screen keys.\nThe front is as usual dominated by the display along with the selfie camera, earpiece and the usual array of sensors on the top edge, with a layer of 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass on the top with rounded display corners. The curves make the phone easy to hold and facilitate smooth operation, despite sporting a 5.99-inch screen size.Turn the smartphone around and you will first see a vertically placed iPhone X like rear camera setup, where the LED flash is housed in between the two lenses. Frankly, this is not the first time when an Apple design feature has made its way to other smartphones. Remember when the dual rear camera setup of the iPhone 7 Plus was unveiled, how many handset makers got &quot;inspired&quot; by the design?\nMoving on, the back panel also has a centrally placed fingerprint sensor and the Mi branding below it. The handset comes with a micro-USB charging port (we fail to understand why) that is placed at the bottom, along with 3.5mm audio jack and the mono speaker. There's a volume rocker and power button on the right, while the left side has a SIM card tray. The top of smartphone has the IR blaster that lets it control devices such as a TV. \nComing to the display, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5  has a 5.99-inch screen with a FHD+ resolution of 2160x1080p. The display comes with features such as Reading mode, which reduces the blue light emissions; Schedule that lets you customize the period of this reading mode; Contrast and colour selection and text size options. The images were quite sharp and we did not see any pixelization. The sunlight legibility is not one of the best suits of the device and we also felt the display looks slightly dimmer, when viewed from a certain angle.\nOverall, we can say we did not have any complaints with the slim body design and is definitely going to grab some attention, even if it&rsquo;s just for the rear camera panel.\nPerformance and camera\nLet&rsquo;s talk about the specs of the device as it comes with a noteworthy feature. Debuting along with the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Pro is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, making it the first smartphone in the world to be powered by it. This new chipset features the newest Kyro technology, claimed to be seen in the 800-series chipset. Apart from this, the Note 5 Pro has 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage.\nThe device runs Xiaomi's MIUI 9 skin based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and should hopefully receive an Oreo-based update as all major launches of this year now are expected to come with the latest operating system. The MIUI 9, like the typical Xiaomi UI, has no app drawer and therefore all apps are placed on multiple home-screens. It comes with an app lock feature and dual apps space customized theme option. The leftmost home screen comes with quick cards that show the frequently used features and information. It is placed in the form of cards, similar to Today's page in iOS, that show shortcuts, calendar, take a note and more. This can obviously be customized as per the user and comes in quite handy once you start depending on it.\nOne thing that we must point out is that even though the handset has a third-party theme support, these apps are not yet optimized for the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display. There is a blank black patch that comes on the lock screen if you select any app and it surely gets on your nerves after a point. When we asked Xiaomi about this, they said, &quot;Starting this month, all official themes from Mi India will be adapted to 18:9 aspect ratio. Also, third-party theme developers are being pushed to adopt their themes for 18:9 phones.&quot;\nIn short, right now you get only two native themes that are fully supporting the display.\nWe ran Antutu and GeekBench 4 tests on our device. While the phone scored 100031 in Antutu Benchmarks, the single-core and multi-core scores on GeekBench 4 were 1772 and 4227 respectively.\nDuring our testing, we found the overall performance of the Xiaomi Note 5 Pro to be simply incredible. The phone handled multi-tasking of random app in a smooth lag-free way. We did not encounter any frame freezing of any kind. Both the call quality and the Audio quality are also quite good. The issue persists with the speaker placed at the bottom as the sound gets muffled when the device is placed in a landscape mode.\nThe Xiaomi Redmi 5 is backed by a 4000mAh battery that easily lasted us for more than a day of average use that included playing games and browsing social media apps, with Wi-Fi turned on.\nIf this review help ful then like\nit", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "18 Mar, 2018", "reviewer": "Narendra singh"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "XIAOMI has made a high end phone in a very small budget", "review": "This phone is a great value for money. I bought this on a flash sale and the phone was delivered to me on the very next day. Mi phones over the years have made a good name for themselves. The phones are made in India as it is written on the back of the packing. Mi note 5 has a huge 6\" screen which is more than enough for people who are looking forward to use it in playing games and watching movies. If you are smart and tweak the settings of this smart phone to just the right amount, 4000 mAH battery is more than enough to last the phone for 1.5 days. Slim and metal like finish of Note 5 phones makes it feel very comfortable to hold it in the hand. Like promised I got a slim back cover for the phone which was packed alongwith the phone, charger and sim opening pin. 3GB RAM will ensure smooth running of apps and 32 GB of internal memory will ensure ample space for storing official files and other data. Even if that is not enough, there is a provision for attaching a mico SD card in place of the second sim. Thank you XIAOMI for making this phone in such a small budget. Thank you Flipkart once again for making shopping so much more easy.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "10 Mar, 2018", "reviewer": "Arnab Ghosh"},
