{"rating": 5, "title": "Value For Money", "review": "Got this within 24hours. Super fast delivery from Flipkart, but packaging was not impressive.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the box content.\n-::You\u2019ll get in the box::-\n1)\tDesh Ka Smartphone-RedMI 5A\n2)\t1 User Manual & Warranty Guide\n3)\t1 SIM Ejector Tool\n4)\t1 75cm long Data Cable\n5)\t 1 Charger(5V 1A)\n\n-::Specs at a Glance::-\n\u2022\t5\" 720p HD LCD Screen\n\u2022\t2gb & 3gb RAM\n\u2022\t16gb & 32gb Internal Storage\n\u2022\tSnapdragon 425@1.4Ghz (Quad Core Processor)\n\u2022\tDual Sim(Dedicated SIM2 Slot)\n\u2022\t13MP(f2.2) with PDAF Rear Camera\n\u2022\tFront Camera 5MP\n\u2022\t3000mAh Battery\n\u2022\tAndroid Nougat (7.1.2)\n\u2022\tSkin: MiUi 9 (9.1.1.0)\n\u2022\tStorage Available For 16GB: 8GB\n\n-::Design & Build Quality::-\n\tMade with all plastic. Metallic finishing gives a great look. \n\u2022\tIn left side there are two Slot. One for SIM 1 and MSD Card and other one for SIM 2. Both sims are Nano SIM.\n\u2022\tOn Right side Power Button and Volume Rocker. On top 3.5mm audio jack, IR Bluster and Noise Cancellation MIC.\n\u2022\tOn bottom  Micro USB port and main MIC.\n\u2022\tOn back 13mp camera with single LED flash and loud speaker grill.\n\u2022\tOn the front  3-capacitive key(not backlit) 5\u201dHD Screen, 5MP Camera, speaker and light & Proximity sensors. And white LED notification is there.\nAlthough build by plastic, but build quality is really impressive and sturdy. Feels a bit sleepery in  hand. So get a cover.\nI\u2019d like give 8.5 out of 10.\n\n\n-::Battery & Charger::-\n Redmi 5A comes with 3000mAh battery. Due to the power efficient processor(SnapDragon 425) the battery lasts  a day perfectly for normal user.\nBut the charger provided is 5v 1Amp, which is very low for a 3000mAh battery. Takes almost 3hours to charge.\nI\u2019d like give 7 out of 10.(3 points deducted for weak charger)\n\n-::Screen::-\n5\u201d HD lcd provided. Colour production is good enough but viewing angles are not great(it\u2019s just average).\nI\u2019d like give 8 out of 10.\n\n-::Sound::-\nSpeaker is loud enough. You won\u2019t miss a call. But there is lite distortion while audio playing at the highest volume.\nI\u2019d like give 8 out of 10.\n\n-::Sensors::-\nAll basic sensors are provided except Gyro. So, you can\u2019t play VR content. Be aware of That.\n\n-::Camera::-\nAt this price segment this is the best you can get.\nBut Don\u2019t expect too much at 5000.\nIn out side image comes out almost natural, a bit sharpness added by the software.\nAt indoor with artificial lighting, there are low detailing in images.\nAt night/low light camera struggles a lot. Very noises are there.\nAt this price can\u2019t complaint at all.\nI\u2019d like give 7.5 out of 10.\n\n-::Specifications and Software::-\nRedmi 5A's specifications are pretty much identical to those of the Redmi 4A, which it replaces. You get the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor, with four cores clocked at 1.4GHz. The screen measures 5 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 720x1280. There's a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, FM radio, and GPS are supported. You can choose between a base variant with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and a more expensive one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.\nThe changes, if you can even spot them, are extremely subtle. The Redmi 5A actually has a slightly smaller battery, at 3000mAh down from 3120mAh. It also has a dedicated microSD card slot rather than the Redmi 4A's hybrid dual-SIM arrangement. It uses Nano-SIMs rather than Micro-SIMS, and the maximum supported microSD capacity has gone up from 128GB to 256GB. That's pretty much it - one feature that's slightly worse, and one that's a bit better.\n\n-::RAM Management & Performance::-\n\u2022\tGenerally when no extra app running on background(except system app) 850mb out of 2gb stays free. With 3 to 5 apps running (chrome,youtube,fb,settings,music etc..) 430mb stays free.\n\u2022\tMultitasking is impressive with normal apps.(did not tried with heavy apps) Split screen works fine too)\n\u2022\tIn gaming: I played  Dead trigger 2 with no issues at all. But Asphalt there are some frame drops but playable.\n\u2022\tAnd For general usage there are no hitting issue at all. \n\n-::Pros::-\n1.\tNice Built quality, looks great\n2.\tPrice point-Extremely affordable\n3.\tGood battery life and performance\n4.\tNo Hitting Issue for normal gaming and other uses\n\n-::Cons::-\n1.\tNo Gyroscope\n2.\t1 Amp charger\n3.\tWeak Camera\n4.\tAverage RAM Management\n\n\n-::Verdict::-\nAt this price(4999 even in 5999) not a single manufacturer will provide these specs. So, if you are on a tight budget or you are looking for a secondary phone for you or your parents. Then you should definitely go for this.\nOtherwise I\u2019ll suggest you(specially if you can spend more bucks) wait for Redmi 5 & 5plus to come in India. Or go for Redmi 4.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "8 Dec, 2017", "reviewer": "Abhishek Choudhuri"},

Many featurs are there --among them- mi remote ( with infra red port) which acts as a universal remote, screen casting to a smart by just one click, u can personalize ur status bar are some special features in it. Display quality is excellent. Sound quality is average.\nOverall It is simply superb. I suggest all to buy this phone.
