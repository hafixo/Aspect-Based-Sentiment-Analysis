{"rating": 5, "title": "Samsung S8 is the Tardis of the smartphone world!", "review": "Review from a guy who used almost 60 mobiles in last 10 years. :D\n\nFirst Impression :\n     The first thing u ll notice is the GORGEOUS display. \n     Infinity display with curved edges makes it look stunning.\n     No words to express the beauty of this smartphone.\n\nBuild Quality :\n     Over a decade, Iphone was leading smartphone industry because of the build quality.\n     Its time to change the era.\n     This Samsung S8 build quality is as good as iphone or even better.\n     Sexy Design and Solid Build Quality.\n\nDisplay :\n     Infinity Super Amoled Display is the best display ever in a smartphone. No competition here.\n     Quad HD+ display is crisp and vivid.\n     Battery life using Quad HD is almost same as using Full HD.\n     Some games like Clash Royale are getting BLACK BARS on top and bottom because of the new resolution 18:9. Hope games will be developed to support 18:9 resolution soon.\n     Videos has to be played with DEFAULT PLAYER to view in full resolution. Video players like MX player are not yet supported for 18:9 resolution which are cropping the video to display in full screen. No problem with default video player though. \n\nCamera :\n     Best camera in smartphone as of now. Only competition here is Google Pixel XL.\n     Back Camera is almost same as S7 edge. \n     Front camera has been upgraded to 8MP from 5MP in S7 edge.\n     Tons of options like slow motion, Blur effect are there.\n\nPerformance :\n     This is another area where Iphone was shining for the last decade.\n      Now Samsung has optimized the phone to match the performance as same as Iphone 7. Finally Android is competing IOS in performance thanks to Samsung developers for such optimization.\n      Exynos processor is much better than Snapdragon in performance. Good that Samsung launched Exynos version in India.\n\nBattery :\n     No phone under 4000 mah can match this phones battery performance.\n     I have used almost all the Snapdragon devices, the thing which are same in all the devices are heating. This Exynos is not at all heating which leads to better battery backup.\n     Easily getting 5-6 hrs SOT using 4g data and Quad HD display.\n\nSecurity :\n     We have seen Youtube reviewers saying the FingerPrint sensor position is awkward and not reachable. Trust me in S8 there is no problem at all in reaching Finger print sensor. Though there is issue with S8+ since the phone is huge.\n     We will be used to this finger print position in a week. So problem here.\n     Also Iris scanner works flawlessly, super fast unlocking. I am surprised  to see how Iris scanner works in complete dark area. \n\nWater Proof :\n     Used under water camera in wonder la. Fabulous. \n\nAudio :\n     AKG earphone is awesome. Its crisp and clear. But its not BASS lovers. Bass is low. But the clarity is ultimate. We are getting it for free what else we can expect here.\n     Audio quality in Exynos processor is a bit better than Snapdragon.      \n     Equalizer software does the job well.\n\nPersonal feel :\n     I'm getting happy and energized seeing this beauty. \n     I would suggest to get S8 than S8+. Perfect size to hold and finger print sensor can be easily used.\n\nConclusion :\nIf u can afford 58k blindly go for it. No 2nd thought.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "2 May, 2017", "reviewer": "Kalai De Bluffer"},

TouchWiz has improved immensely and has a really nice feel to it.\nThe major qualm I have is the Bixby button. It's just physical bloatware, which is worse than the bloatware inside.  If Samsung would have allowed us to remap the button to our choice, then that will be a game changer. Better than the new Pixel 2 or U11's squeeze function.\nBixby is still very new so it'll probably get better over time with software updates but until then it's nowhere near compared to Google Assistant or Apple's Siri. \nThe Camera is fantastic, great low light ability as well. The selective focus mode is decent but not excellent and has some way to go. Other modes such as pro or food are nice addition. \nThe speakers are good and loud although they sound a little tinny on high volume. And then there's the headphone jack. One of the major reason why I purchased the phone. Out of the box, it comes with AKG tuned earphones which are decent but if you love your sound, you're better off with  earphones from Sennheiser or Sony.\nDecent battery life with some really quick fast charging. With average to above average use and it still lasted me the whole day.\nFingerprint reader is not the fastest of the bunch but still not bad.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Super!", "review": "Never reviewed a phone although I have bought around 20 mobiles including Nexus series (everything except Apple) in 12 years. But couldn't stop myself from writing about Samsung S8. I am using this one as my primary driver since May 3. Waited till the wireless charger arrived as that would have been the  only bummer in my purchase. Now that I got the charger which works like a charm, I decided to write something about my experience with this ultimate Samsung marvel which I think can only be replicated by Samsung only.\nThis phone:\nIs a visual delight and a beauty to hold.\n\nHas worked fine till now(I don't play games on my S8) without a single glitch.\n\nHas a camera which produces photos unmatched with any phone I had( I also have the S7 Edge).\n\nHas finger print scanner (once you get used to it) and Iris scanner(Blazing fast even in theatre dark) which are 99% accurate along with face recognition.\n\nHas infinity display(don't have words to describe it's beauty). Just watch any HD movies on this and you get hooked to screen. I watched the entire India Pak match on S8.\n\nHas a new Experience UI which is much much much better than the TouchWhiz. The hidden tips and tricks videos on You Tube helps you unravel umpteen features in this ultimate phone.\n\nThe only drawback as per me is its battery life. Battery life on S8 is not that good for power users. The screen on time is around 3 and half hours with 4g network. But for that Samsung has provided fast charger which is very handy and charges the phone very quickly.\n\nI am glad I purchased this as I wondered after S7 Edge how can Samsung entice me to buy it's next flagship. It did.Kudos Samsung\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc96", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "7 Jun, 2017", "reviewer": "Satya Mishra"},

But I had a bad experience within 2 weeks of purchase when all of the phone's sensors stopped working. Flipkart refused to replace. Had to approach the service center. They took 4 days to fix during which they replaced the motherboard. Has been running fine since then(fingers crossed), been around 3 months. Would have rated it a full 5 but for the bad experience at the onset. It's a great device, great look and feel, beautiful color, good battery, amazing screen but only about average software experience(in comparison to stock android or even oneplus or moto iterations), with occasional slight stuttering but has no other major issues .

If I'm paying 60k, I expect everything to be delivered. Even the promises. And Samsung has fallen way short of my expectations. It's been One and a half months now and all Samsung is doing is making me chase my own tail. They acknowledge their mistake, yet have not resolved the problem despite me providing all documents that they asked for. Rubbish. Samsung, you let me down. Totally. As a middle class guy buying his mother her first beautiful smart phone, I expected more from you on the promises you made as a company. \nRegarding the phone, it is beautiful.

About beautyand performance,  its exceptional there is no doubt in that and is the main source of attraction at any place. Experience UI looks very light and classy in comparison to the Samsung's earlier heavy Touchwiz. Battery backup is good. As i have noticed, 70% of charge lasts for entire day with 4G LTE and Location ON for messaging, browsing and with some VoLTE calls. Iris scanner response is incredible. Camera shots and videos mainly in low light is remarkable due to its bigger aperture. Touch response is amazing but gets degraded if Tempered Glass is used as it introduces some gap between the glass and the screen therefore, I removed it in the very 1st day.
