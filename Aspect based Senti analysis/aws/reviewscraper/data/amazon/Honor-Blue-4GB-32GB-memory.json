I really wanted to brake some\nmyth revolving around this phone.  \n1 Low light photography : First of all for this budget honor has provided a\nvery good camera . Some people who feel that the phone is dull in low light\nshould change their settings and its a gem.  \n2\\. Not good for gaming: Honor 7x comes with Mali Gpu which is old but not a\nbad one and they often compare with Adreno Gpu . Of course, Adreno is powerful\nbut Mali is only slightly below par . Reviewers often play Alsphalt Airbone 8\nto compare gaming performance which has lot of graphics and eats a RAM. At one\npoint any budget phone in the market will definitely have some nags when you\nplay such a high quality game.  \n3\\. Phone is not corning gorilla : Come on guys 2.5 D glass is same as corning\ngorilla which protects your screen from scratch and breakage.  \nPros :  \n1 . Extraordinary camera  \n2\\. Elegant screen display  \n3\\. Beautiful Design  \n4\\. Classy blue color  \n5\\. Smooth EMUI 5.1(Waiting for face unlock in next update EMUI 8.0 Oreo)  \n5\\. Powerful performance  \n6\\. Duplicating apps.  \n7\\. Honor cloud storage  \n8\\. 3400mAH battery.  \n  \nCons :  \n1 .Only cons is no fast charging.  \nOverall you can go it if you are looking for a long lasting, stylish, budget\neasy, better build and full screen display!\n\n", "The phone is amazing. As some users said the flickering screen i too have\nfaced it for one time. Thats what made me dissappoint but with an software\nupdate it went away.  \nThe camera is good but rear potrait mode, dual camera are nof satisfactory.\nOverall i liked the phone. The battery back is okk eith me.\n\n", "Decent look with display but camera out put not ok as mentioned by Honor. Well\nover all it's good device.
