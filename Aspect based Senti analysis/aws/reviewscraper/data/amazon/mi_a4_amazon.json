In todays global\nscenario the company should very clearly share this information with the\nbuyer.\n\n", "Ever wondered that \"I wish my phone had this feature then it would have been\nsomething more\" Well Redmi 4 got everything you would wish for a stable phone,  \n> better camera,  \n> fingerprint sensor,  \n> ir blaster,  \n> gyroscope,  \n> ambient light sensor,  \n> led notification customization,  \n> Both Sim slots supports volTE, 3 gigs of RAM, 32 gigs of storage,  \n> metal body with 2.5 D curved glass which gives a much premium look than any\nother phone even higher than this price range,  \n> 5 gigs free of MI cloud storage  \n> No heating issues at all (stay away from hoaxes)  \n> Can play heavy games and 1080p videos without any lag  \n> Can easily purchase original glass protector from mi.com @Rs 129 only  \n> Only one con as far that it has hybrid sim slots, Either 2 sims or 1 sim & a\nmemory card however they tried to nullify it by providing OTG support so yes\nit does support OTG  \nXiaomi nails it again  \nBest phone in the price range\n\n", "Xiaomi Redmi 4 key features  \nBody: Anodized aluminum back, 2.5D display glass. Black and Gold color\noptions.  \nDisplay: 5.0\" IPS LCD, 1,280x720px resolution, 294ppi.  \nRear camera: 13MP, f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus; 1080p/30fps\nvideo recording.  \nFront camera: 5MP, f/2.2 aperture, fixed focus; 720p/30fps video recording.  \nOS/Software: Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow; MIUI v.8.2.7 custom overlay.  \nChipsets: Qualcomm Snapdragon 435: octa-core CPU (8x1.4GHz Cortex-A53), Adreno\n505 GPU.  \nMemory: 3GB of RAM; 32GB of storage, microSD slot for expansion.  \nBattery: 4,100mAh Li-Po (sealed).  \nConnectivity: DualSIM (micro+nano); LTE Cat. 6 (300Mbps/150Mbps); microUSB\n2.0; Wi-Fi b/g/n; GPS, GLONASS, Beidou.  \nMisc: Rear-mounted fingerprint reader; single speaker on the bottom; 3.5mm\njack; IR emitter, FM radio.  \nMain shortcomings  \nHybrid second SIM/microSD slot limits your options  \nAndroid Marshmallow, still?  \nNo fast charging so you can't top the 4,100mAh battery in a pinch  \nAll in all-  \nXiaomi's on a winning streak with them Redmis and the Redmi 4 is another in a\nlong list of super affordable 5-inchers that cover the basics without breaking\nthe bank. Love our flagships as we might, not everyone needs the latest\nhardware or has money to burn, and that's where the Redmi 4 comes in.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 review  \nYou get a bright display, which despite the otherwise average contrast is\nquite usable in the sun. You'd also appreciate the solid battery life - the 4\nmay not be the battery champ that the 3 was, but it'll be there for you on the\nlongest of days. We just wish charging were faster.  \n  \nSome may find MIUI too colorful, but Xiaomi's Android overlay is feature-\npacked and will save you a few trips to the Play Store for everyday tools.\nThere's plenty of room for customization too, and the privacy features are\ntop-notch. Oh, and you do get a fingerprint scanner, which some of the big-\nname brands cheap out on for their entry-level models.  \n  \nThe camera output won't necessarily win blind shootouts, but photos are sharp\nenough, and the FullHD videos are among the better ones we've seen, on a\nshoestring or otherwise. The selfies are decent too.  \n  \nThe thing is, it's hard to find competition for the Redmi 4, not at this\nprice. In fact, if you're eyeing the Redmi 4, it may be Xiaomi's own lineup\nthat you need to look at for alternatives. There's the Redmi 4 Prime with a\nFullHD display and a more powerful Snapdragon 625 chip. Going for the Redmi\n4a, you'd save a few bucks, but concede a gig of RAM and 4 CPU cores resulting\nin a tangible dip in performance. Also, no fingerprint reader on the 4a. Or,\nyou can go bigger and opt for a Redmi Note 4 - larger and higher-res display,\nmore powerful chipset, even better battery life.\n\n", "I am very happy with the device. It's fast, it's reliable, battery life is\namazing, camera is awesome. Touch is wonderful even with a tempered glass.\n(I've used phones that slow down on touch with tempered glass) but this one\nruns like a horse. I charge it once in two days with my regular usage, earlier\nI had an iPhone and I had to charge it twice a day. I love the connectivity\nthat the phone offers, I can even control my TV with the IR blaster! In all,\nvery happy that I switched from iPhone. The ability to send files from my\nlaptop to phone via bluetooth is something so simple, but god damn, I missed\nthese simple things on iOS.\n\n", "Kudos to amazon for delivery within 24hrs under prime,  \n  \nComing to actual product, after using it for a couple of days the followings\nare my opinions,  \n  \nPros:  \n1\\.

The battery\nlife is outstanding. Fingerprint sensor is quite accurate and relatively fast.\nThe only thing that lets this phone down is the screen resolution, but hard to\ncomplain at this price range.

Would definitely recommend this phone.  \n  \nWould update this review with feedback from a weeks use.\n\n", "Worth for what you pay, at this price the best phone that one can afford.\n\n", "Liked this phone\n\n", "Nice phone in this price\n\n", "Sir, i am very much dissatisfied with the colour resolution of this phone,\nwhich is purchased by me at so much higher price of Rs8999/-, compared to\nother brand mobile phones like of Samsung, Vivo, Oppo etc. at this higher\nprice, whose colour resolutions are much better. .Also today i have got the\nmail from you that this 3GB RAM, 32 GB Memory is being offered to sell at\nRs.6999/- only. i have purchased the phone about 30 days back only. So i have\nincurred a huge loss by not waiting for this lesser price of the phone. I am\nalas! But the other various features of the Phone is very good and\nsatisfactory. If you kindly can compensate me for my unfortunate loss any way\nby any means , then I shall be pleased with your marketing policy.

Have always been an avid fan of Xiaomi smartphones\nand other products. Xiaomi products have never disappointed me. Redmi 4 is\nalready a long player in the budget smartphone market loaded with competitive\nfeatures and a nice battery. The phone looks good too (doesn't look like a\nbudget smartphone if not informed). What is more interesting is that me and my\nbrother in law have earlier used redmi note 3 together. And now we have four\nredmi 4 smartphones in our family. My mom, my wife, my brother in law and now\nme, each of us are having one redmi 4 as our secondary backup phone.  \n  \nLet me tell you this makes an awesome secondary backup smartphone along with\nyour primary one. The jet black colour suits my taste and gives it a more\npremium look.  \n  \nI am also amazed to find Xiaomi has given us a smartphone with all metal\nanodised aluminium body and a massive battery capacity of 4100 mAh at this\nprice.  \n  \nThe phone runs smooth and lag free even with a mere 2GB of RAM. I think most\nof the credit for this should go to the better performing SD 435 octa-core\nprocessor. The display size of 5\" made it a perfect smartphone to hold\ncomfortably on my palm unlike the larger devices (5.5\"-6\") that tends to slip\nout of your hands often. The fingerprint sensor works fast enough.  \n  \nThe only con I have found till now not only about this smartphone but all\nXiaomi smartphones are the idea of a 'hybrid sim slot' that compels you to\neither run for increasing more space (which you'll do anyway considering this\nhas got a mere 16GB of internal memory) or use a secondary sim, but not\ntogether.  \nAnother con is the camera. I won't say the camera is bad but it is decent,\ngiven the price point. Moreover, I have always felt the photographers should\nrun after a professional camera if they want a perfect camera and should never\nlook for a pro level camera in a smartphone. Smartphones are smartphones, not\nDSLRs.  \n  \nTo sum up, Redmi 4 makes an awesome budget smartphone and deserves to give\nSamsung a run for their money in the low-end budget smartphone segment because\nanyway, Samsung smartphones are pathetic in performance in this segment. And\nof course, it is a perfect gift to have! Thank you Wifey!\n\n", "I am using redmi 4 since last 1 month.Redmi 4 was launched two months ago.it\nis the successor of redmi 3s and 3s prime launched last year.It comes in three\nvariants: (1) 2gb ram+ 16gb storage at \u20b9 6999 ( 2) 3gb ram+ 32gb storage at \u20b9\n8999 and last 3gb ram+ 64gb storage at 10999.Here I am going to review it's\n3gb version-Display: it's screen size is 5 inch, size is low but it is more\nconvenient to use from single hand.it looks very much pretty in your\nhand.Performance: I am using it daily almost 18-20 hours.Mostly I prefer to\nbrowse facebook.You can easily run games like injustice 2 or asphalt 8 or\nmodern combat 5 on it.I found no lag while using this phone.let me talk about\nother phones which are available in market.In this range there is no any other\nbetter option than this phone.Memory: Out of 32gb, 25gb is available for\nstorage.it is sufficient enough for any user.Camera: It comes with 13\nmegapixel rear camera whose performance is satisfactory.There is also a 5\nmegapixel front camera without any flash.Camera performance is satisfactory\nnot good.Battery: It is the segment which is specially highlighted by xiaomi\nin advertisement.It comes with 4100 mAh battery.Battery backup is very nice.\nYou can easily use it for 14 hours continusously on 4g network in single full\ncharge.Fast charging is not supported.Only disappointment regarding this phone\nis that it is not available easily in market.Only few stores in delhi have\nredmi 4 in stock.it is available only online exclusively.\n\n", "4 stars for Redmi 4 mobile and 5 stars for Amazon and its delivery.  \n  \nAbout product : It is the best choice for the price range less than 10k.  \n  \nPros:  \n\\+ Slim and easily operate in one hand. Back cover is very slippery due to\nmetal finish, suggested to use case cover to avoid slipping from hands.  \n\\+ 2.5D curved glass and back cover metalic finish give premium look to the\nmobile.  \n\\+ It supports Jio 4G VoLTE. Voice call clearity is good and no issues with\nnetwork signal or wifi or wifi hotspot.  \n\\+ Good performance with the Snapdragon 435 SoC, didnt feel any lagginess.  \n\\+ Rear camera is 13mp shooter and good quality images in natural lighting.\nNot so great in artificial lighting. Front camera is 5mp and good for selfies.  \n\\+ Supports most of the apps and games.  \n\\+ Good finger print response, very accurate always. Built in security app\nused to lock the apps (using both finger print or pattern/pin), no need of\nthird party apps to lock/protect apps. Antivirus app comes built in, top of\nthat we can use other security protection applications also.  \n\\+ Supports OTG devices. GPS and Compass sensors are giving exact location\ndetails to use in the map.  \n\\+ Good battery backup, solidly it comes 1 to 1.5 days of dual sim (3G+4G),\nfb, whatsapp and checking mails usage, still there will be 25-30% battery left\nat end of the day. Heavy gaming - more than 12 hrs.  \n\\+ Custom friendly UI interface, thanks to MIUI developers.  \n\\+ Some people complaining about heating issues, but I did not feel any\nheating issue even with high graphics game usuage (Asphalt 8, Modern combat).\nFeel that they didnt do regular patch update. I do regular patch update\nimmediately when it comes on OTA, that could be reason that I didnt get\nheating issues.  \n  \nCons:  \n\\- No turbo charger with the package. It has regular 2.0 Amp charger only. We\ncan still use fast charger as the mobile has Snapdragon 435 processor which\nsupports fast charging.  \n\\- No screen production like Gorilla glass 3/4 or Ashahi dragontrail. Within a\nmonth, my mobile got hairline crack in screen for accidental drop from less\nthan one feet hieght. So only they didnt mention anything in description about\nscreen protection.  \n\\- MIUI consumes more RAM. Always it shows 1.5GB RAM usage (out of 3GB) even\nthough when no apps running in background.  \n\\- No regular Android OS version upgrade. Still in Marshmallow based MIUI 8.5.\nReceiving regular MIUI patch update for 3 to 4 months once, but not OS version\nupgrade. Shortly we will get Android orea in other mobiles, but Redmi 4 is far\nbehind and stuck with Marshmallow. It is only problem with MIUI based\nproducts. MI has to think about this.  \n  \nAbout amazon.in and its delivery:  \n\\+ It is great as it is always.  \n\\+ Good packaging.  \n\\+ Delivered even before the estimated.  \n\\+ I bought it in Tuesday flash sale, the product claim went 100% within 2\nminutes, but I was added in the queue for waiting list and placed the order\nwhen my turn comes.  \n  \nThis is review of the Redmi 4 mobile after 6 months usage.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 13 August 2017", "on 23 December 2017", "on 16 September 2017", "on 23 December 2017", "on 21 January 2018", "on 27 December 2017", "on 6 August 2017", "on 5 March 2018", "on 15 October 2017", "on 17 October 2017"], "reviewer": ["Amazon Customer", "Tufan Saha", "vishwadeep", "Patri Prudhvi Krishna", "Sathvik Shetty", "Rekha", "Amazon Customer", "Subho Mitra", "sanjeev suman", "Divya"]},

Best phone in this price range, I bought it after doing loads of online\nresearch and reading through thousands of reviews and I am not at all\ndisappointed. Go for the 32 GB model priced at 8998, don't buy the 16 GB\nmodel.  \n2\\. This phone looks awesome too, similar to iPhone 6S just without the home\nbutton. Its pretty sleek and stylish.  \n3\\. Camera is pretty good, good colour reproduction in proper light.  \n4\\. Screen quality is good, bright and vibrant. Touch is smooth, accurate and\nfast, no lag.  \n5\\. Doesn't get slow because of the 3 GB RAM, great performance.  \n6\\. Battery life is good, about 1.5 - 2 days if you use wisely and charge\nwisely.  \n7\\. Have not experienced any heating problems so far.  \n8\\. Finger-print sensor is fast and accurate.  \n9\\. MUI on top of Android looks pretty decent and attractive, doesn't slow\ndown the phone. MI has added many extra features on top of Android which are\nuseful for aggressive users like me.  \n  \nCons:  \n1\\. Speaker loudness is bit less, but that shouldn't be a problem. If you want\nto hear very loud music use bluetooth speakers!  \n2\\. Low light photos are bit poor, but better than most mobiles in this price\nrange. It serves the purpose perfectly fine. You can't expect photos like\ndigicam from a budget mobile!  \n3\\. The home, back and menu buttons at the bottom of the phone doesn't glow.\nThis isn't much of a problem as you get used to the keys in a few days and you\nknow where they are.  \n4\\. Some preloaded apps can't be removed. This also doesn't matter much\nbecause the ram and processor is enough to keep the phone running blazing\nfast.  \n6\\. This phone has 2 SIM slots, 1 nano and 1 micro. The micro sim slot is\nhybrid which means you can either insert SIM or Memory Card in it. I hear\npeople complaining about that, which is foolish because 32 GB is a lot and\nthink if you really need memory card even after that!  \nAlso only 1 SIM can have 4G network activated, other will run in 3G/2G which\nshould be also fine because usually only 1 SIM is used for internet (like Jio)\nand other SIM is kept only as a backup number for calling / SMS.  \n  \nVerdict: Buy this mobile blindly if your max budget is 10K.\n\n", "Overall Redmi 4 is best under \u20b97000 as it has fingerprint sensor which Redmi\n5a and Redmi y1 lite doesn't have and also it has better processor (Snapdragon\n435 which is octa core) and also 4100 mAh battery. I do not care about the 16\nGB internal as we can use external sd card upto 128 GB but I have given it 4\nstar because in 2 GB( approx 1836Mb) ram only 850 Mb ram was free. I got MIUI\n9 update as soon as I connected to WiFi!!!\n\n", "Multipurpose Phone!!  \nEverything is perfect.  \n  \nDesign :-With a unibody metal construction, the Redmi 4 follows the design\nlanguage of Redmi Note 4. There are curved edges with a curved 2.5D glass on\nthe front which aids the ergonomics. The highlight of the design is of course\nthe compact form factor owing to the 5-inch display. It fits quite well in\none\u2019s palms and single-handed usage is a breeze.  \n  \nThe build quality is excellent and it feels solid, and the matte black variant\nlooks great and gives a very premium feel.  \n  \nHowever, the three capacitive buttons behind the display are not backlit. It\nis disorienting at first, but you impulsively know where your thumb needs to\ngo after a few days of usage.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 might be a budget phone but there\u2019s no compromise on the\naesthetics. In fact, with this outing \u2013 like before \u2013 the company sets the\nstandards for what affordable smartphones should look and feel like in 2017.  \nDisplay :-The Redmi 4 sports a 5-inch HD display with a 1280 x 720 resolution.\nThere\u2019s a 2.5D curved glass, similar to the Redmi Note 4. It\u2019s toughened\nglass, although there\u2019s no Gorilla Glass protection  \nThe HD display nevertheless looks fantastic in terms of color reproduction and\nviewing angles. The images and text looks sharp, and it is clearly one of the\nbest displays on smartphones in this price segment. Maintaining a perfect\nbalance, it is a crisp and vivid display without the colors looking\noversaturated.  \nConclusion :-Starting at \u20b96,999 ($108) for the base variant, the Redmi 4 ticks\nall the right boxes and there is hardly anything to complain. It\u2019s a great\npackage with solid chassis, Qualcomm\u2019s newer chipset, decent camera, and great\nbattery life. The only shortcoming of the device is lack of Android Nougat out\nof the box\n\n", "My father owns RN4 which is similar to this R4,fews things are missing in this\nlike  \n-5 inch screen  \n\\- notification light is in bottom  \n\\- no double tap to wake  \n\\- only single white LED light for charging, notification, etc  \n\\- no slow motion video recording  \nBut Overall build quality very good, buttons are sturdy, didn't like hybrid\nslot, (tenor is good in this case) I have Exchanged it with my old Samsung\ngalaxy note 2 for Rs. 2k this is my 3rd phone purchase on Amazon\n\n", "best quality and budget phone but always remember that if you are purchasing\nthe XIAOMI phone ,you should very careful about its screen/display. You should\nuse screen guard and back cover. The service center service is worst\n\n", "Xiaomi redmi 4 is the company's latest model in the sub-rs 10000/- segment.\nXiaomi has so far seen a string of successes with its redmi range with most\nmodels finding place in our periodic list of the \"Best Budget Phones.This new\nxiaomi redmi 4 will not onlyhave to take on the competition,but also live up\nto its predecessor in a lot of ways, and it certainly seems like an improvment\nwhen it comes to specifications.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 specifications and software  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 features a 5-inch HD (720x1280) IPS display with 2.5D curved-\nedge glass. This seems to be the first time that Xiaomi is using 2.5D glass on\na Redmi smartphone priced below Rs. 10,000. There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery, and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. The phone is powered by an octa-\ncore Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. There are three\nvariants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; one with 3GB\nof RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. Our\nreview unit had 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports\nexpandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).You get a 13-megapixel\nrear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED flash. There's also a\n5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. The new Redmi 4 will support 4G\nand VoLTE along with other connectivity options. When two SIM cards are used,\nonly the primary one will allow 4G calls and data while the secondary SIM\nfalls back to 2G calls only.The phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with\nXiaomi's MIUI 8.2 skin. This is a stable build which is identical to what we\nsaw on the Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4A. This means that the Redmi 4 has a lot of\nsoftware features that we have already seen, including Dual Apps, which lets\nyou create a second instance of any app and supports Facebook, Instagram,\nTwitter, WhatsApp, and more. The Quick Ball feature lets users assign\nshortcuts for features. One-handed mode shrinks the display to one corner of\nthe screen so that everything's easier to reach. The phone also gets a\nscrolling screenshot feature that will let you take screenshot of an entire\nWeb page. Child Mode lets users lock apps, and Second Space creates a separate\nprofile to help users manage business and personal data on the same device.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 camera  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy. Compared to the Redmi 3S Prime, we found that\nautofocus on the Redmi 4 was a bit quicker. Camera samples were detailed and\nsharp, with colours that were vibrant and truly popped. Landscapes had\naccurate colours for the most part as well as reasonable detail. Macro or\nclose-up shots had a slight haze when seen full-size on a desktop monitor,\nthough the HDR mode helped to some extent.  \n  \nUnfortunately, turning HDR mode on made image capturing and processing really\nslow, and this is one of our biggest complaints with the device. With HDR on,\nusers need to be steady for a few seconds to get a good shot, or else photos\ncome out looking awful.  \n  \nThe rear camera has a tendency to capture a lot of noise when there is no\ndirect light source. Some camera sample shots taken in the dark were very\npoorly defined and had too much motion blur. At night, the Redmi 4 managed to\ntake good photos only when we were close to the subject under a light source\nsuch as a streetlamp.The Redmi 4's camera app is minimalistic and easy to use,\nwith controls for various settings and features occupying only a small part of\nthe screen. HDR mode is just a tap away, as are the live filters. The phone\ncan record video at 720p and 1080p, and the videos came out decent overall.  \n  \nSelfies on the Redmi 4 can be an issue if you want a candid one, again because\nimage processing is slow. We ended up with a slew of blurred selfies just\nbecause we wanted to take one quickly. Other than this issue, our sample\nphotos taken in good light had a good amount of detail and decent colour tone.\nIn low light, we had a tough time, and faces came out looking too grainy.  \n  \nOverall, the Xiaomi Redmi 4's cameras are definitely an improvement over those\nof the Redmi 3S Prime (Review), in terms of focusing and results. There are\nfew issues like poor low-light shots and slow processing in HDR mode, which we\nhope can be fixed - or at least improved upon - with updates.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 performance  \nGeneral performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is decent, and the device handled\nmost tasks well. The MIUI interface at times felt sluggish, but this doesn't\naffect performance within apps such as when playing games such as Asphalt 8\nand Cut the Rope 2. We had no major concerns during the entire review period.\nThere was also no noticeable overheating.  \n  \nOur unit had 3GB of RAM, and there was roughly 1.2GB free at any given time,\nwhich means those on the 2GB RAM variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 might struggle\nwith multi-tasking on their units. Despite roughly 1GB of free memory on our\nunit, we didn't have to deal with any crashes or slowdowns, but we would\nrecommend opting for the variant with 4GB of RAM if you can spend a little\nmore.  \n  \nVoice call quality was decent, and the phone supports VoLTE. The phone doesn't\nship with a headset, so we checked the sound quality using our own earphones,\nand were quite impressed. You get several options to tweak music with the Mi\nSound Enhancer feature when using earphones. The Redmi 4 was also able to play\nour assortment of test videos with ease.The 5-inch IPS display is bright and\ntext appears sharp. The screen is crisp with decent viewing angles. However,\nthis isn't the best HD display we've seen on a Redmi phone. Colour\nreproduction is decent, but in our opinion, the Redmi 3S was better. The\nscreen was readable and usable under direct sunlight. Movies and games look\ngood on the 5-inch display, though some might prefer a bigger screen. There's\na Reading mode on the device that reduces background glare. Users can manually\ncontrol colours and saturation on the device through the Settings app.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 scored 43,677 in AnTuTu and 22,996 in Quadrant. We also ran\n3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench, where the phone scored 5,890 points and\n25fps respectively. These scores are on par with those of other phones powered\nby the Snapdragon 430 processor.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 lasted for 14 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test,\nwhich is impressive. We can partly credit the battery loop test performance to\nthe low-impact HD screen resolution. With regular use, the battery lasted over\na day. There are also power saving modes to help squeeze more life out of each\ncharge. The phone doesn't come with a fast charging adapter but Xiaomi's Jai\nMani told us that it does support fast charging. We can expect Xiaomi to sell\na fast charging adapter for the Redmi 4 as an optional accessory, or you could\nbuy a third-party one.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 17 August 2017", "on 29 September 2017", "on 31 January 2018", "on 19 November 2017", "on 20 August 2017", "on 10 December 2017", "on 21 September 2017", "on 7 October 2017", "on 15 August 2017", "on 17 January 2018"], "reviewer": ["LAWRENCE Rock Fort Rider", "Angel S.", "Gagan Ahuja", "Hariharasudhan", "Ratul", "Amazon Customer", "Raghu Reddy", "Nandita Das", "anurodh kumar", "deeppokar"]},

Basically anything except high end gaming or hd camera\nrelated. Since the camera isn't good imo but again I'm not into taking\npictures but for video calling and stuff it's good enough.  \nI Love this phone, do the get me wrong. It's perfect for me It has most of the\nthings I would prefer. And it's 5 inches so fits my hand perfectly since I\nhave small hands. Designs looks epic but I had a bulky case now but still good\ndesign. Over all it's a good device and yes it will heat but nothing to the\nextreme unless as I said you do heavy gaming or constant use where battery\nusage is more. Not sure if anyone even gonna read this but do think between\nthis and Redmi Y1. Another reason for 4 star is that this device came almost\nyear ago so not sure how many future updates it will get but since Y1 is new\nnow so it will get more updates than this device so go for it. I'm salty that\nY1 released after I brought this phone but anyway I still love this device.\nHave fun with yours. ;)\n\n", "The phone was delivered safe and sound.
