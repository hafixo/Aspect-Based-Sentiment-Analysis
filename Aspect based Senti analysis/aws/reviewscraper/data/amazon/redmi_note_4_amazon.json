The display is good\ncrispy colour sunlight eligibility is quite good viewing angles of display\nokay. Camera is good but not as expected. Fingerprint recognize very speed.\nBattery life is awesome non removable Li-Po 4100 mAh battery.

If delayed, I shall be bound to order return of the product.\n\n", "As always, Amazon Delivery Is Excellent.  \nProduct: A little bit of doubt regarding the product Received. Packaging is\ndifferent as compared to what I received from Flipkart. Adapted is different.\nAdapter cable is quite short in length as compared to what came with Flipkart\ndelivery.

Run all games on the highest settings. (minor heating in graphic consuming\ngames)  \n2\\. Almost no overheating at all. (unless you've opened an app and left the\nscreen on without sleep for a long time)  \n3\\. Best screen resolution and videos on 1080p are AWESOME. (can run 60fps\nvideos as well)  \n4\\. Massive storage which can hold an insane amount of apps.  \n5\\. Frequent updates for MIUI which fix bugs and improve performance and\nappearance.  \n6\\. Different supported official ROMS where you can enjoy Android Oreo and its\nfeatures before release.  \n7\\. The metallic frame which makes the phone more solid and overall, the phone\nis comfortable in your hands.  \n  \n======  \nCONS:  \n======  \n1\\. Relatively bad camera. (duo to RN4's high screen resolution, you'll feel\nthat all picture taken from it are unclear as if you're watching 480p video on\nHD Screen but they're great if you open them on other phones)  \n-Bugs!!! RN4 System and MIUI Apps aren't perfect so they frequently give us updates to fix these issues but still they're annoying when they occur. (still, they aren't serious)  \n2\\. Purchasing a Glass Screen and a Phone Case is a must. (RN4 doesn't have\nGorilla Glass or full metal frame so it'd be better if you buy those)  \n  \nIf someone is looking for a budget range phone, then this is device you should\nlook for, or if you can spend a 2k more then MI A1 is the best.  \nI hope I was helpful to you.
