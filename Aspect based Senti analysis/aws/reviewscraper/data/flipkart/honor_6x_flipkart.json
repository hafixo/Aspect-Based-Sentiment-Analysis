{"rating": 4, "title": "Value for money", "review": "Honor 6x is a decent phone. Both front and rear camera quality is good. Audio quality is average. Though cellular call quality is good. Configuration and performance are up to the mark.\n\nBut what if a technically sound phone irritates you whenever you use it?\n\nThe phone's internal look and feel is good. What I hate about this phone is its font, font colour, and background.  Imagine a very thin font with light grey colour and a white background. It hurt your eyes easily after using it for a while. No theme can change that irritating font style, colour, and white background. This kills your eyes slowly.\nHuawei should think about that. They should allow users to change the font-colour, font-style, font-size and background colour according to their preference.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "8 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Malay Pradhan"},
