{"rating": 3, "title": "Fair", "review": "I will devide my review into four parts\n1. Pros\n2. Cons\n3. Things I didn't liked\n4. Things I liked\n\n1. Pros:\n 1.1) Battery backup is very goot. Even it is 3000mAH battery, it is giving more than 6.5 hrs of screen on time.  \n 1.2) Performance is excellent. Compare to MiUI, it will open apps fast and the speed is also good\n 1.3) Back camera in day light conditions is working super. 2X optical zoom is capturing details clearly. Depth of field effect also too good. I can't post pictures here. But will provide you if you want :)\n 1.4) I am a moderate user. I will maximum use Facebook and browse some YouTube videos. I didn't face any heating issues\n  1.5) 3.5 audio jack is giving quality, loud output. 50% volume is enough to listen songs loudly. Speaker quality is also very good and loud\n 1.6) Full charge will take 1hr 40 mins. It is less compare to other mobiles which don't support fast charging\n  1.7) Touch buttons are having back LED. So you no need to suffer in night conditions\n\n2. Cons\n 2.1) Notification light is single color. So it will blink in white color for any notification. \n 2.2) IR blaster range is reduced. Previously my Mi5 works better. I am able to change the channels from anywhere in my room. But now it is working if I am in 2-2.5 meters range only\n 2.3) Fingerprint sensor is slow. It is taking almost 2 sec to unlock the Device.\n 2.4) Back camera in low light is taking poor quality images. Too much of noise in that\n 2.5) Front camera is below average. Shutter speed is not good so always giving blur photos. \n\n3. Things I didn't liked\n Since it is pure Android, most of the MiUi features will not be available. So read below points if you are a MiUI fan\n 3.1) No double tap wakeup. There are so many apps in playstore. I tried most of them but they are asking admistrative permissions. Fingerprint print unlock is not working if we allow these permissions to outside apps. This may be possible by rooting but I won't recommend rooting because it avoids warranty.\n 3.2) No quick ball. You have to use side button to lock device. Even screen lock apps are not working because of the reason mentioned in 3.1\n 3.3) No one hand mode. Phone is 5.5 inch and slippery.  So very difficult to use it with one hand without one hand mode\n\n4. Things I liked\n 4.1) Initially slow motion video is not working. But they fixed it yesterday (Sep 28th, 2017) by update. This one is good that they are responding quickly\n 4.2) I got September security patch also. You will be up tto date with this device.\n\nFinally this is my review after using it for 14 days.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Awesome", "review": "Yesterday I received my A1. Exact 48 hours after order. It's great to see Flipkart delivery time even my area doesn't have fast delivery/one day delivery.\nNow comes to the phone.\nA super smooth OS with excellent hardware makes this phone great. I order the black colour and I recommend it.  It has a beautiful premium look and feel. The build quality of this phone is outstanding. Really nice to see a excellent set of dual camera because I think Tele+Wide is best combination (it's my own opinion).\nNow comes to pros and cons:\nPROS:\n1. Android One gives you smoother experience and guarantee for future update, current running on 7.1.2 but promised for Oreo and P. (Oreo will be before end of year and P will be in first batch)\n2. The superb built quality makes this phone an aye candy and Gorilla Glass 3 protect from scratches\n3. The Dual camera performe superb in good light conditions and Portrait Mode works like a charm. The tele photo lens has 2X optical zoom which work great.\n3. Even it has 3080 mah battery it will last for 1 day. It has a 14nm finfet based Snapdragon 625 chipset.\n4. Loudspeaker is loud enough actually pretty loud and clear.\n5. It has USB type C Charging port and seperate 3.5mm earphone jack which is very good. If you has a good quality earphone/headphone you'll fall in love with is superb sound.\n6. RAM management is excellent, keeps all the app in memory.\nCONS:\n1. Camera Struggle in low light conditions and it hasn't Auto HDR and EIS (hope Xiaomi can fix last two in future camera update).\n2. There is No FM Radio which I'll not miss much when you have Jio.\nI have a Redmi Note 4 and I this apart from battery it will beat Note 4 in every segment and biggest score will be in camera.\nAt this price range Moto G5S plus is almost identical but is has a promised update which is not going good with moto user. However Camera is a little bit better but not when comes to portrait mode.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "15 Sep, 2017", "reviewer": "Prakash Jaiswal"},

Now when the brand itself is already Chinese , does it really matter? \n2) Camera struggles in low light. Front camera is AVG and nothing new when compared to last generations of phone. Should have been better considering it a new 2017 model.Xiomi lost in this front and low light camera performance department when compared to other similar range phones.\n3)Hybrid sim slot whithough this is same in all smartphones dese days.\n4) Type-c charging -- Although 3.5 jack is provided for songs but one still need only a type -c cable for connecting this phone to adapted or pc. Surely U won't found these cables around u with it forms/family...so it's a must carry thing if u r travelling and phone needs charging .\n\nFinal words--- Overall a gud premium looking phone with decent performance. Take it if u want a cheap phone  with decent dual camera setup and love  stock Android.\n \nDon't take if u want a gr8 selfie phone or a phone with low light camera performance. \n\nGiven 4 stars coz the model delivered had loose volume keys ...though  I didn't replaced .\nDo like if this review helped!! \nAlso post it questions in comments.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "6 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "sachin saurabh"},

{"rating": 4, "title": "Wonderful", "review": "#####REVIEW AFTER USING FOR 2 MONTHS#####\n\n1. UI : Fluidic Stock UI performance. Go for it if you a stock Android fan. Not recommended for MIUI fans but it is  worth noticing that the performance of Stock Android is better than MIUI 9. 5/5\n\n2. Camera : Dual Camera in the back is steal deal. It can capture some of the great shots in broad daylight. It really gives DSLR feel. In low light, bokeh effect can't be noticed. Also, the photo is grainy in low light conditions. Front camera is average. 4/5\n\n3. Built Quality : Complete mettalic body looks very premium. I have black edition which looks stunning but the problem is that a slight fall is enough to give dents on your mettalic finish. So, anyway you need a good case to protect the body. 4/5\n\n4. Updates : Android One ensures that you will keep geeting all the Security patches and major updates atleast till Android Oreo and N. Though, Oreo is yet to be rolled out but promised by the end of 2017.\n\n5. Battery : Battery life is okay. I get around screen time of 6-8 hrs with heavy use but it is decent considering 3000 mAh. Full charging time is not more than 75 mins. Not a fast charger but Type C port works decent enough.  4/5\n\n6. Screen : The 5'5 inch screen hits the sweet spot and it is bright enough for you to use A1 in daylight. \n\n7. Sound : Speakers are loud dand crisp. You won't feel that there is only one set of speakers in the bottom. Also, you will get clean sound with5/5\n\n8. Connectivity : No problem for 4G network. Works fine with both Jio and Airtel. 5/5\n\n9. IR Blaster : IR blaster works fine though range is not more than 3m. 4/5\n\nVERDICT\nOverall this is the best phone you can get in this segment. Great camera, 4GB ram, 64 GB storage with Stock Android can give you the best experience even though, there is trade-off between selfie camera and battery life that you have to make. 4/5.\n\nPlease like my review if it helped you in any way.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Terrific purchase", "review": "First of all thanks Flipkart for the fast delivery and timely updates. Now coming to the phone itself , its the best phone you would get for the 15000 price bracket. No phone has everything in it but considering the 15k price bracket you will get the full value for money. Moving to the important details about the phone, If someone is thinking to get their hands on a very good smartphone for the mentioned price, I would like to list out the matters regarding the phone\n\n1. Though the screen is a 5.52 inch (not 5.5 inch) full hd IPS LCD display with a ppi of 399, it is worth mentioning that Xiaomi this time has worked a bit more to bring to the users what I would say is a top notch hardware having the perfect blend of sharpness and colour reproduction. The display shows adequate balanced colours which are not too cool yet sufficiently warm. The screen brightness is amazing as my 2day usage states that only 75 to 80 percent brightness is enough under direct sunlight. I have previously used several phones including the company's own Redmi note 4 but I wasn't satisfied with the brightness and the screen appeared dull in bright sunlight even on full brightness. The last point to note is that it has stunning viewing angles.\n\n2. The camera setup is what which was being talked about immensely and is also highlighted by Xiaomi even. Frankly speaking when I thought of purchasing this smartphone after using two other Xiaomi phones in the past, I was expecting an average camera performance. But after testing the camera thoroughly, I would give a 9/10 rating to Xiaomi which is really nice for 15k smartphones. The rating is so because the camera really struggled in artificial or low light producing artificial colours but it produces real accurate colours in outdoor lighting conditions. Though I hope Xiaomi will come up with some software Tweeks for the camera to improve its performance. Even the portrait mode doesn't seem like artificial as in the case of several smartphones.\n\n3. Considering Xiaomi's battery backup in the past , I thought that the battery of 3080mAh would last only about half a day but I am getting a battery life of almost 22 to 23 hours on utterly heavy usage with a screen on time of almost 9.5 to 10 hours roughly. Great job Xiaomi for providing good battery management by the 625 chip and stock Android software.\n\n4. The phone provides a rich gaming performance thanks to the Snapdragon chipset supported by the adreno 506 GPU and 4gigs of onboard ram. The phone is surely a mammoth.\n\n5. Due to Google's crisp software the ram management is superb as each and every app is retained in memory and does not reload when you revisit them.\n\n6. Out of the provided 64 gigs of onboard storage we get roughly around 51 gigs for use which should be enough for even a mobile gamer. Unless you are a media lover and like storing movies on device.\n\n7. Though mentioned late in the review but the build quality provided is something very premium. The phone feels sturdy in hand and thanks to its excellent design and balancing by Xiaomi, the sleek giant is really a thing to adore while it's sleeping. The phone is 7.3mm thick weighing 165grams but the in hand feel is way less than that. It actually feels much lighter than the note 4 which weights the same.\n\n8. One more thing to highlight is the audio output via the headphone jack. Personally I am a person who loves listening to a whole lot of songs ranging from high base ones to the ones on the treble end. The phone manages it like a pro responding correctly to whatever you throw at it. The audio DAC provided is really of top standards.\n\nOverall it's a balanced smartphone. If you are a rough user then don't worry the phone is definitely for you due to some excellent build and mr. Corning in your confidence. Do give a thumbs up you found the review useful else give a thumbs down. Thank you.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "12 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Chirantan Gupta"},

I'm not getting full 4G speed. Tested with Airtel, idea and jio however these SIMS works smoothly with my iPhone 7 and xaiomi note 3. while searching for the solution I found so many customers facing same problem even mi community acknowledge the fault. On paper, phone is amazing but it is literally defective. My friend has same phone and he face Network issue and he realized it after 15 days, now he can't even return... So guys check your phone performance and compare the speed with another phone..\nFlipkart service is slow and outdated, they promised me to call at 3 but after too long wait I got msg apologizing that they will call after 2 days.. I'm very old Flipkart customer. I used to be a Flipkart first customer but now their service is poor. I repent buying phone from them...\nUpdate... Flipkart guys rejected return request . I can prove it is a faulty phone. Technician visit is such a fake, illiterate technician, even a common person is more intelligent than him, they are taught to convince customer and rejecting return request is their main aim.
