{"rating": 5, "title": "Worth every penny", "review": "As my budget was tight so i reviewed many products and finalised this TV. Brought it on regular price which was 18000 at that time.\n\nTV was delivered in 3 days. I myself opened the box as there is no wall mount is given in package i attached the stands. It was easy to attach there are only 4 screws.\n\nSet up tv with videocon d2h normal connection and turned it on. I previously used my CRT monitor with Tv tuner card. And after watching channels on this tv i found the colors are over bright and clarity is somewhat unclear. After playing with color and other settings the clarity and brightness got perfect.\n\nThere are 3 most useful color settings \n\nDynamic- If you have seen samsung super Amoled screen phones then is is same to that. Punchy and more vibrant colors.\n\nStandard- Regular and soft colors\n\nMovie- Slightly yellowish effect \n\nI played 720p and 1080p videos and the clarity was awesome.\n1080p 60FPS videos lag sometimes but no one watch 60FPS because regular movies and videos are 30 fps.\n\nComing to the sound this TV has slightly low sound 10w but for small room it is not a problem. There are also sound settings like movie , vocals and other. And DTS surrounding which is not much effective.\n\nBut tjere is also and 3.5mm audio output so you can switch anytime with clicks to Tv autio to home theaters.\n\nOverall i found this Tv is a great deal.\n\nPros:- \nHigh contrast ratio\nVibrant colors\n2 years warranty\nMany modes like indian cinema, movie , game etc\nAmazing viewing angles\n\nCons:-\n\nThe colors are over saturated than SONY tv. They may look pleasant to eyes but they are not 100% accurate.\n\nThe hardware refresh rate is 50-60Hz. And samsung tells 100Hz which is software optimized rate and not real.\n\nYou may need extended usb cable if you mount this Tv on wall because the usb port is on back side. Not in side panel.\n\n\n\n\nIf you just want brand in budget then buy this TV. Bacause in same range or may be at cheaper rate you get VU FULL HD 32 inch and believe me no difference in screen quality. \nAnd if you want to see everything as it is same as real life like picture quality then buy SONY 29 IINCH led tv.\n\nThumbs up if you found it useful ?", "verification": {}, "date": "6 Nov, 2016", "reviewer": "Omkar Khele"},
{"rating": 3, "title": "Economic option. Don't expect a lot.", "review": "Positives:\n\n- Sound quality: Worth the money.\n- Picture quality: Worth the money.\n- Product weight: Very light weight. Can easily carry around while shifting houses.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- All integration points (input plug points like HDMI, USB) are facing the wall and not side ways. So you will have issues in easy plug-and-play if you are wall mounting it. Please beware. \n- Don't expect network connectivity at this price. Just plug a Chromecast and stream whatever you want or plug a USB and play what ever you want.\n\nBuy this TV if you have a 10-12 feet hall. If its more, you may have to go for bigger screen.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "19 Apr, 2017", "reviewer": "Individual Person"},

They send third party to test sound and that dumb said all is fine, even given feedback that all company now selling low sounds TV.\nFlipkart if you are not ready to do any action with your seller then you will loose you genuine customer like me.\nAgain I would say, guys don't buy this.
