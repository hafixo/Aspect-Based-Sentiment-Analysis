Same happened to the\nMoto G2 about 2 days later. The problem was not with the charger because I've\nbeen using the same Charger for both the phones for the past one year or so.\nOne week after getting this, both the phones faced this problem.

I loved the cable, its long, feels rugged. It gives proper charging\ncurrent/voltage and I checked it with 2 phones using Ampere app. Go for it at\nthis price .
