This does mean that there's room for Apple's trusty Touch ID sensor underneath the display, though, which has so far worked flawlessly every time.", "\u2022 \u200eLike the\u00a0iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is waterproof too, thanks to the handset's IP67 certification which means, in theory, it should withstand being dunked into water up to 1 metre for 30 minutes.

It apparently is, according to Apple, which boasts that the glass on the phone's rear is the \"most durable glass ever on an iPhone.\" We haven't managed to drop our iPhone 8 yet, but it feels like it could withstand a tumble or two.", "\u2022 \u200eElsewhere on the handset you'll find the Lightning port on the bottom edge is flanked by a speaker and microphone, and there's nothing up top. There's no return for the 3.5mm audio jack, but Apple includes a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box.", "\u2022 \u200eThere's also updated stereo speakers, which make the phone around 25 percent louder than the iPhone 7.", "\u2714\ufe0f DISPLAY:", "\u2022 The iPhone 8's display is largely identical to the iPhone 7.

Yet, the Apple iPhone 8 doesn't go beyond the iterative upgrade we've come to expect from an S model. Is it because it's impossible to not take into account the iPhone X? Or is it the new all-glass design is looking too familiar?", "Maybe it's the way Cupertino handled some of the upgrades. Like the camera did get better thanks to a new sensor and larger pixel size but Apple isn't exactly verbose about the new imaging technology. There's fast-charging support too but with a caveat: you're not getting it right out of the box. Not with the supplied charger and cabling.That, and the steep price may give Apple a hard time justifying the iPhone 8, especially to iPhone 7 users. With no intention whatsoever to downplay the good stuff about the iPhone 8, the new model and its spec sheet are pretty predictable. The price is therefore a bit of a surprise - and not a pleasant one either. Then again, Apple's never had a problem getting the price it thinks is right. Plus, the iPhone 8 may turn out to be convincing enough.
