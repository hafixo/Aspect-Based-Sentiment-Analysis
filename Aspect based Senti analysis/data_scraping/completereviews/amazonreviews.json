Will last for one day easily.  \n-Sensers: has major sensors accelerometer , proximity , gyroscope,etc and even pedometer which calculates you steps kilometres you have Walken.  \nCons  \n-Little slippery as it is glass built.  \n-Camera at low light not much great.  \n-lacks NFC and IR blaster.  \n-some heavy games may hang if pushed to its limit.  \n-Little over priced.  \n  \n***Note*** Many people complaining that seconds sim slot doesn't support\n3g/4g. But it does ! You have to go to settings>dual sim settings and select\nthe sim from which you want to use 3g/4g . That's it! ( But yea both sim cards\ncannot be used as 4g at a same time.

That's what my friends commented upon seeing my Honor 8\nLite. Yes, of course, the phone is sexy and premium. But is it worth the\nmoney? Me, Dijo Jackson writing after two months of Honor 8 Lite usage.  \n  \nWhat takes this phone to the limelight? Obviously, it's glass finishing.\nEarlier I had Honor 6x, but upon the launch of Honor 8 Lite, I raced to\nacquire one. I was really impressed by the way phone looks.  \n  \nFirst of all, the phone gives us the premium feel. But upon on close\ninspection, I went little upset. The volume rockers + power button are too\nflimsy! In fact, this wasn't in my expectation. However, I was still content\nthe way phone rules.  \n  \nAs of my character, I hate to use back covers or the tempered glass. So within\na matter of time, scratches are evident on the back glass panel nevertheless\non screen too.  \n  \nNow getting into the performance of this phone, I really liked the new UI.\nQuite cool and different approach from Honor. But it doesn't mean that phone\nis super fast. Though I'm not much into gaming, switching between apps is a\nbit lagging, right from the start. Recently I got an update which made the\nsituation even worse. After the update, RAM consumption went very high.  \n  \nCamera quality is much much better compared to Honor 6x (though it has the\ndual lens). Low light camera performance is 'okay'.  \n  \nAnother draw back I experienced is on the battery front. Seriously\ndisappointed with its battery backup. Phone drains out very fast. For an\naverage user like me, it lasts mostly for a day (don't know how the serious\ngamers will handle this).  \n  \nMy Thinking!  \n  \nHonor 8 Lite is for those, who cares more about looks; who really wants to\nstand out in the crowd. Serious gaming or hardcore use? I would suggest better\ngo for some others.\n\n", "Awesome mobile just go for it. Really good experience after I used iPhone 5s.\n\n", "Performance is very good.

A micro USB port lies in\nthe middle of the speaker.  \nThe volume and power buttons are on the right side and within a thumbs reach\nbut unfortunately not as tactile as we've noticed in some other handsets. The\nSIM card and microSD card slot lie on the left side bezel, while the front-\nfacing camera lies on the speaker grille placed above the display. There is\nalso a multi-colour LED notification light for alerting users.  \n  \nDISPLAY:  \n\u2022 The Honor 8 Lite sports a 5.2-inch display with a full-HD resolution, which\nmakes for a high pixel density. Colour reproduction is neutral but there is an\noption to tweak the colour temperature. If you aren't a fan of punchy colours,\nyou'll like the display. It has good viewing angles but isn't very easy to\nread under direct sunlight.  \n  \nPERFORMANCE:  \n\u2022 Powering the Honor 8 Lite is Huawei's own Kirin 655 SoC. It is an octa-core\nprocessor with two sets of four ARM Cortex-A53 cores. One set is clocked at\n1.7GHz while the other is clocked higher at 2.1GHz. It has an integrated\nMali-T830 GPU, as well as a co-processor called i5 which handles sensor input\nwhen the main cores are in standby, to save power. The Honor 8 Lite also has\n4GB of RAM which in our opinion is more than enough to run all kinds of apps.  \n\u2022 The phone handle most of the apps but, it's not the best processor. It\nsometimes lags during heavy games and multitasking.  \n  \nCAMERA:  \n\u2022 The Honor 8 Lite comes with a single 12MP rear autofocus camera with f/2.2\naperture and LED flash. The colour are well saturated and the images shot in\nboth daylight and artificial light conditions are impressive. The images shot\nin low light are equally good with much lesser noise levels as compared to\nothers during low-light shots. There is one-touch access to most of the\nfrequently-used features such as video capturing, switching between front and\nrear cameras, filters, Beauty mode, gallery and the enable/disable flash\noption.  \n\u2022 There is an 8MP front-facing camera with wide-angle lens, which makes taking\nselfies easier.  \n  \nBATTERY:  \n\u2022 The Honor 8 Lite uses a 3000mAh battery, which in our day-to-day usage ran\nfor over 9-10 hours constantly on a regular use. Light users will be able to\nstretch the running time to over 12 hours easily.  \n  \nSIDE NOTES:  \n\u2022 The fingerprint sensor on the back of the Honor 8 Lite is very accurate and\nunlocks the phone quickly.  \n\u2022 It runs Android 7.0 Nougat with Honor's latest EMUI custom skin  \n  \nVERDICT:  \n\u2022 While most smartphones in the budget segment now have metal bodies, the\nHonor 8 Lite stands out with its glass design. However, those good looks come\nat the cost of the phone being slippery and a fingerprint magnet. The Honor 8\nLite also delivers to some extent on the promise it made on the camera front.\nHuawei's home-grown Kirin processor performs tasks quite well but stumbles a\nlittle when it comes to heavy tasks such as gaming. So, your choice depends on\nwhat are you really looking for in a smartphone.  \n  \nThank You PEACE.  \n  \nConsider giving a ' Helpful Yes Vote'\n\n", "Super products smooth touch and full HD  \nCamera good battery very good fast processing performance good awesome screen\n\n", "Awesome phone i get very fast processor and give a premium look.\n\n", "Heating issues.

This product is\nreally very good as per specification and performance and its stylish look in\nless than 20k after than you go for honor 8 or oneplus, also far much better\nthan other smart phone.  \n  \nThis phone is 4G Volte i tried jio sim in both slot working fine, it show HD\ninstead of volte but working without jio4Gvoice app i.e. really good and saves\nlot battey.  \nCamera performance is owsm, attached few pics in different climate, day,\nnight, rainy, above clound \ud83d\ude02 etc. Different mode in camera is really nice like\ndoc scanning, professional... It worth money for me, slight delay in image\nstabilisation is there ie auto focus but it ok as OIS is not there.  \n  \nBattery back is good and sufficient for whole day with moderate usage ultra\npower saving mode is really worth, u can use selected app with 2 days batter\nbackup.  \n  \nLook is very premium and stylish after iphone and oneplus 3/3t, gives feels of\npremium phone, biometric have fine response and doesn't found any lag during\nworking with it, with normal apps. Display is much attractive and u can\ncustomise it by downloading different themes.  \n  \nI didn't found any issue with touch till date.

Fair enough for this size phone.  \n11) Phone Handles Heavy games like NOVA 3,Asphalt 8, etc Smoothly even at High\ngraphics settings.  \n12) Has OTG Support.  \n13) Has Lots of sensor like accelerometer, gyro,Geo magnetic sensor etc.  \n  \nCons:  \n1) NO Fast Charging.  \n2) NO NFC  \n3) Has Hybrid sim slot, which means you can't use both the Sim & Memory Card\ntogether.  \n4) Processor feels bit lagging when you do heavy multi-tasking.  \n5) Front Camera is not that Impressive.  \n6) Both the camera performance is dull in Low Light conditions.  \n7) Back is bit Slippery, but its compensated by case.  \n8) Ram Consumption by System apps. as usual is High.  \n  \nBattery Performance Stats:  \n# Charging from 0 to 100% takes 2 hrs 15 mins. with stock charger.  \n  \nUsage Mode ---> Battery Performance(Avg.)  \n================================================  \n@ Mobile Data(3g/4g) Used Continuously ---> 6-7 Hrs.  \n@ Normal Calling Only + Standby ---> 25 Hrs.  \n@ Normal Calling + Music Playback( Continuous ) ---> 10 Hrs.  \n@ Internet Usage on WiFi Only( No Calling ) ---> 10 Hrs.  \n@ Gaming ( Wifi) ---> 8 Hrs.  \n@ Gaming ( without WiFi ) ---> 9 Hrs.  \n@ Video Playback ---> 11 Hrs.  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \nVERDICT:  \nAt this Price Tag, its NO GO. Lacks NFC, Fast Charging, Front Camera quality\nand Average Battery Performance.  \nI feel Moto G5 Plus performs way better than this phone.  \nOr if you budget is low, then Go for Vivo V5 or Redmi Note 4, its better\nproduct and value for money.  \n  \nThank You for reading this Review.\n\n", "Product seal is broken\n\n", "So many review... finally I have purchase this one from Amazon.
