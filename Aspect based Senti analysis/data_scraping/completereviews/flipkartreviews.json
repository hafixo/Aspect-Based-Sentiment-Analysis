If you want telephoto lens then opt for MI A1.\n\n\nLittle bit of heating you may experience but thats normal maybe because of metal body.\nHeadphones provide are not an in-ear type but the old one. \nCharging cable or usb cable is of sufficient length.\nBattery backup is sufficient for a day if you are not a heavy user of high end games or prolonged user of camera and video recording.\nOut of 4GB only 2.4GB RAM was available when the device was first bootup.\nOne hand screen mode is available here for those who find 6 inch phone difficult to handle. Well the narrow bezels makes it more easy to hold. Its like holding a 5.5 or 5.7 inch phone.\n\nWith the advent of Iphone X, MI Mix 2, LG G6 and Google Pixel 2XL, 18:9 aspect ratio or bezel-less display will gonna become mainstream in near future.\nSo, if ergonomic design is your one of the highest priority then go with this device.\n\nNote: If front camera is not your top priority go for Honor 7x. Specifications of Honor 7x is nearly same as Honor 9i except for front facing camera which is of 8 MP and the alignment of rear dual camera.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Wonderful", "review": "Well to be frank this piece of awesome device gives scope to iPhone users to think about what a smart android can do beyond the stock features! \nLets talk about the hardware first - Not going into tech specs - \n-The phone looks very premium and superior build quality made of a single metal body. \n-Laced with first in class phone with 4 cameras it's able to achieve bokeh effect on both side cameras.They ensure background blur and wide aperture shots which are very nice. \n-The headphone jack and charging ports are both below which is convenient. \n-The screen aspect ratio and narrow bezels make it look very appealing besides having a sharp &amp; greater than 400ppi clear resolution can be compared with other premium high priced phones below 30k. The fit option on most of the apps enable them to adjust them to the long screen size.. with the launch of new Pixel phone 2 the world will move towards it.\n-The Huwaei sound enhancer helps obtain the 3d sound besides giving us an option to customize the sound output.\n-The battery lasts for a day at ease with a nominal screen usage for a professional. There are provisions to change settings as to what to keep running after the screen is locked.\n- I loved the charging screen animations as well besides the premium animations like icon refresh, icon badge, notification bar display , etc.\n-The Android version 7.0 coupled with the other enhanCments are a grand welcome . Double knocks takes screenshot, Knock swipe can split screen apps, the finger sensors can change pics while on gallery, answer calls, swipe up/down the notification without a need to take your thumb to the respective screen part. Lots of these good features.\nAll in all this phone is built by a market leader that has produced Nexus phones for Google , and a lineup series of Honor, Holly phones with great user satisfaction. While the world is innovative I think the brand has worked really hard with the engineers to get quality innovation packed in a reasonably priced awesome phone. So thanks to everyone at Huwaei !!\nNeed improvements areas-\n-Quick charge or even wireless charge- Ready to pay for it \n- After warranty support by brand is one thing that Huwaei has to work on just like Nokia and Samsung. That will be helpful for people who use a single device for more than a year!\n- No other complaints as such minor glitches will go off air in  a few updates .\nThanks to our readers for tolerating a long review!", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "18 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Darpan Kumar Chaurasia"},

Now coming to the review, it's a pretty decent device. In some areas even it scores more than my old mobile. Let's see what it offers. The things that impressed me here are \n1. Selfie cam (Definitely it should have been a selfie device, portraits are awesome)\n2. Display (18:9 crispy one)\n3. Built quality (As I came from a flagship killer of last year, I was thinking a lot about it but trust me it's very solid and premium, honestly a head turner)\n4. Rear Camera ( Best in this segment, sorry for some unclear portraits anyway but other than that it's a gem)\n5. Audio via headphone jack (Surely better than OP3T's and good too)\n6. Ergonomics (it's easy to hold and use in a single hand, just using the case given and weight distribution is also fine)\n7. Battery (It's not a battery king but easily get through a single day SOT 4-5 hrs despite being a heavy user and I am loving it as my old device doesn't get me through the next day)\n8. User Interface (Lots of doubt about this before moving from Oxygen OS to EMUI but loving it, now am not even using the app drawer which makes my app pickings very easy)\n9. Call quality (Very Clear through earpiece and loudspeaker too)\n\nNow let me show you the things which are not tasty in this \n\n1. Battery Charging time 2-2.5hrs( Not too bad considering its price but definitely missing dash charge technology, still some YouTube videos are misleading as it's very slow and so on but really not is  true)\n\nVerdict: Decent mobile for 16.25K during Diwali sale using HDFC card, really loving it's camera nd toying with this. If you wanna better camera device then just pick this. Beautiful one. \n\nDon't trust the YouTube blindly as I did in the past to buy mobiles and tech stuff, that's why I wanna write my experience here. Just read the user experience and go for a device.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Nice product", "review": "Beautiful &amp; Decent Phone:\n\nWriting this review after 10 days of usage.\n\nDisplay:\nIts one of the best u can get in this price range, 18:9 aspect ratio with Full HD+ display. It is simply awesome &amp; build quality is also good.\nNo issue with display &amp; build quality till now. Color reproduction is also good.\n\nRAM:\nWith 4 GB RAM &amp; 64GB ROM, its does a decent job. Can observe little lag during switching b/w apps, but its negligible &amp; can cope up with that.\nBut no major issues with RAM management till date.  \n\n\nSoftware &amp; Hardware:\nIt runs on Nougat 7 with EMUI 5 out of the box. Will get plenty of features with EMUI &amp; will love it, especially the Knuckle gestures. Not all the apps has been optimized for this phone, but will get used to it. Honor can resolve this with their future update.\nWith Kirin 659 Octa Core is does a decent job. But it fails to perform well while playing heavy games or games with high graphics. This mobile is not for heavy gamers. No heating issues observed.\n\n\nBattery:\nOn a normal usage, it will last for a typical day ( if charged fully in morning, it will end up till evening with around 20 - 30% of charge left ). But for heavy users it will last for upto 12 - 13 hours. And battery drains quite quickly (especially while using camera). Honor could have gone with more power battery for this 5.9 inch display. Battery performance could have been better. Charging time is also more. It takes almost 2:30 to 3 hours to fully charge &amp; no fast charging supported &amp; No USB TYPE C. Its quite disappointing for this price range.\n\n\nCamera:\nFront camera is very good &amp; takes beautiful snaps. Its one of the best selfie cameras one can get in this price range. Portrait mode works well with front cam. It does a decent job even in low light conditions (with some noise). But, overall performance is well &amp; good with front cam. If u are a selfie lover, u can go with this without any doubt. It performs even better than MI A1 &amp; G5 S+.\nBut with Rear camera, its performance is not upto the mark. Its quite disappointing. Even though with 16+2 MP cameras, its performance is quite dull. With good light condition or in day light, it works very well, but in low light condition its performance is degraded. The Portrait mode &amp; bokeh effects do not perform well with Rear cam. The blurring effect is not well optimized (pics come out artificial), as well as Portrait mode. Both cameras over saturates the color &amp; if we zoom the pics, it will loose the details. \n\n\nOne issue that I faced was with FM RADIO. I was unable to hear FM through earphone if the phone was ON, but once the phone was locked was able to hear through earphone. For this we need to change the settings.  Settings --&gt; Google --&gt; Search --&gt; Voice --&gt; 'Ok Google' detection, in this UNCHECK the Say 'Ok Google ' any time option. After this FM issue will be resolved. \n\n\nVERDICT:\n\nIts a beautiful design, great inhand feel, beautiful front cam, an average rear cam, lots of features with EMUI &amp; an average battery back up. \nIf u care more about design &amp; display, a decent phone performance, a selfie lover &amp; a moderate user, u can just go ahead with this Honor 9I.\n\nBut if u want a great performance, with a good battery life,  good rear cam , got an option with MI A1 &amp; MOTO G5 S+. \n\nCONS: \nMinor lags.\nNo Gyroscope sensor.\nSometimes while watching Youtube, it will get exit automatically.\nBattery life is bit low. \n\n\nPROS:\nDesign &amp; Display.\nButter smooth UI &amp; screen.\nGreat Front cam &amp; an decent Rear cam.\nLots of customized features with EMUI \n\n\nOverall, its a well designed &amp; well built phone with great Front cam, loads of features &amp; worth the money. Its recommendable !!\n\nHappyy with my purchase :)  \n\nHope this review might help..", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "11 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "Yogesh R"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Fabulous!", "review": "So i read all the reviews here, mostly were positive and some were negative, but i thought i'll give this phone a try!\n\nSo here's my Honest opinion about the phone.\n\nWill make this review simple. Not gonna go into specs, you all already know enough about that.\n\n1. First this is the display! It a HD+ display and looks stunning!! Seriously.. each and everyone who saw the phone actually complimented about the display! One thing though, I think the display should have been more bright at the full level. Also, the phone is really Sleek Slim and light weight! The look and feel is superb!!! Note-  It comes with a screen Guard (NOT TEMPERED GLASS). I advice you to get a tempered glass asap coz this phone doesn't have gorilla glass.\n\n2. It has 4 camera's. 2 front and 2 back. It clicks awesome pictures especially in daylight. It has a flash in front, not exactly a powerful one, but a small &quot;soft flash&quot;. Overall the image quality is very nice. One thing that i noticed is the portrait mode in the front camera looks a little too artificial when you use Bokeh mode.\n\n3. Next is the phone's multitasking. Well it's brand new, it's flawless right now. No lags, nothing. Not even while switching apps. So no cons here. (i'll update if required)\n\n4. The Finger Print Sensor is accurate and Blazing fast! Kudos to that.\n\n5. Speaker - I don't know why some comments are saying the speaker has low volume. It's more than sufficient. It's loud actually. So it's really good in my opinion.\n\n6. Battery &amp; Charging -  Ok, so too much negative review about charging. My opinion - Yes it's a little slow, but my phone went from 55% - 94% in about an hour or so. So i don't think that's really bad. Also, i went to office (around 9am) with 81% battery and with moderate use (4g/wifi always on) watching some videos, regular use of whatsapp and facebook, and at around 3 pm, it was on 55%. So i don't think that's bad either. You guys decide.\n\n7. Knock Gestures - If you've seen some youtube reviews, you might know that this phone has &quot;knock on screen&quot; gestures. For some reason, i can't use that properly, 7 out of 10 times it doesn't work properly. Maybe I'm using it wrong. (i'll update about this)\n\n8. Ram - phone has no lags whatsoever right now. normally, 2.-2.4GB of RAM is free normally.\n\nOverall, if you want to buy a phone that's really a bang for your buck, this is the one!

{"rating": 4, "title": "Good choice", "review": "First of all I should thanks to flipkart for this amazingly quick delivery (within 12 hrs.).\n\nNow coming to the phone itself.. The HONOR 9i !! Being an honor phone user from last 3 years I am happy to say that this time also honor doesn't upset me with it's quad camera beauty !! \n\n1. Both the cameras are shooting beautiful images with very good sharpness levels and punchy colors . the bokeh mode of the front camera is simply unbeatable at this price point. Low light shoots are also pretty good.. \n2. The screen quality is excellent. I have to say Honor has used a very good IPS panel for the device and the metal build of this smart phone is extreme good and also the in-hand feel is really premium. Though in my opinion, using a case will be \n     safe because the phone is a lot slippery.   \n3. RAM management is great due to 4 gb of ram and you will get almost 2.25 gb of ram free for every time, do note that facebook, instagram, whatsapp etc power intensive applications stays in memory constantly and also some back \n    ground processes runs continuously in memory for example Google sync etc.\n4. I have to say that although the processor is well capable to handle almost all the day-to-day tasks without any issue, the GPU is not at all capable for high end and even semi-high end gaming. I am not a big fan of playing Asphalt 8 or \n    modern combat 5 in mobile because I prefer to play those games in my Windows 10 PC but I heartily wished at least PES 18 will run in Honor 9i flawlessly as it runs in my Redmi 4 without any issue, but it disappoints me for the first \n    time. Even PES 18 is also almost unplayable in Honor 9i !! But when I tested NFS No Limits it ran without any lag or frame drops! By the way, Pokemon Go like games will run very efficiently. I don't know if there is any software \n    optimization issues or not but I really wish Honor will look after this matter! Also there is one point to be mentioned here, that there is no HEATING issues I have noticed as of now.\n5. Out of 64 gb storage you will get roughly around 49 gb free space on the first boot. But you can also use a micro SD card for storage expansion, therefore storage will not be an issue for most of the people I guess.\n6. The highly customized EMUI 5.1 with various themes is one of my favorites. But I thing there is also some people who prefer stock android experience. So,  I am leaving it on personal preferences. \n7. Finally the main thing.. The Battery Life. Honestly it can manage to go through a full day having at least 20% charge in it with my semi heavy uses daily but due to the lack of fast charging it takes a looong time to charge the battery \n    completely to be precised 2.5 hrs., which is really irritating I must say!!\n\nSo, in conclusion I should say if you can compromise with high end gaming just go for it. You can hardly notice any difference in performance of Kirin 659 against it's most popular rival Snapdragon 625 and even 626 (except gaming).\nAnd trust me guys, when you hold this phone in hand for the first time it will surely make you &quot;WOW&quot; than holding Mi A1 or Moto G5s Plus, I wish everyone of you should experience that &quot;WOW&quot;... :) \n\nI hope this review will help to choose the correct phone for you.\n\nThank You :) :)", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "4 Dec, 2017", "reviewer": "Subhajit Ghosh"},

Even though the EMUI is heavily customsied UI, but having processor and software coming from the same house beats that so called Android One Phone. \nThats software engineering!!!!\n\n\nPros and Cons of Honor 9i\n\n1. Bigger Screen. \n2. Better Selfie and Rear Camera in this price segment. \n3  Snappy Fingerprint Scanner. \n4. EMUI5.1 runs smooth. \n5. Speaker's sound is clear and audible.\n\nCons - \n-Fingerprint Scanner is located much closer to the camera setup. \n-Battery backup is average. \n-The Worst part, Charging is very slow. From 16% to 75% in 2.5 hours. 1 Stars less for this.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "15 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Jatin  Johny"},

It can last a day and half on a descent usage becoz i use my phone for calling nd whats app nd other daily stuff but not for hardcore games, so it will stand perfectly on typical day for u.\nOverall its a value for money for me, good phone for daily usage ...awesome camera both selfie nd rear...good Battery life nd no compromises on looks (rose gold edition)", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "8 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "Mohammad Armaan"},

{"rating": 4, "title": "Nice product", "review": "This device is pretty good except the slightly lower performance of the back camera than I expected. The back camera shots are kind of over sharpened and a little bit noisy. In outdoor condition it performed very well, but in lowlight as well as indoors it struggled to give much details without noise. The blurring algorithm is also not perfect. So in the camera department, it needs some optimisation. \nEverthing else is awesome.\nThe battery life seems decent. \nAudio experience on headphones is one of the best with the new huawei histen. \nHoping for an update to make the camera performance the best. :)", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "16 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "Noel Simon"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Excellent", "review": "I was eagerly waiting for the Graphite Black and the day it was available I ordered one...\nWhy I picked Honor 9i? My wife already using Honor 6X and I was amazed by the huawae's phone quality and the camera performance. I have used Redmi but they lack video quality, they are too dark in low light and talking about other camera phones they lack looks,build and performances . So after researching a lot I chose Honor 9i \n\nPros :\n4 cameras are awesome, the front one is best in this segment.\n18:9 aspect ratio \n5.9 inches screen\nGreat built and design\nCan easily handle multitasking\nGood for Vlogging, Vlogging requires good front camera which this phone is having. \n( Do search Nickk Bisht on YouTube for my VLOG, exploring Rashtrpati Bhawan) \n\nCons :\nNo fast charging, takes much time to get fully charged \nLacks OIS so while walking or running, video is bit shaky ( but can be stabilized in post processing) \nNo gyroscope \n\nIn terms of Video recording Moto G5 S plus is good but I hate moto's look and design. \n\nverall it was a good decision to pick this Honor 9i", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "18 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "Narendra Bisht"}]
