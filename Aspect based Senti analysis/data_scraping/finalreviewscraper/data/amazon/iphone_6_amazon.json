From delivery to the product, using\nit has been a sad state of affairs.  \nTo start with the capacity is only 28GB and not 32GB out of which more than\n6GB are used because of built in apps. So effectively you get 22GB and not 32\nGB.  \nThe phone quality is also not what I expected being an iPhone user  \nThe touch sometimes stops working and there is a problem with the signal as\nwell which is perfect in my iPhone 5.  \nTried to initiate return but it didn\u2019t accept.  \nI hope amazon can look into it.\n\n", "Bought it in Amazon sale, got a defective product. Worked good only for a\nweek, started giving trouble in the second week only.  \nIt takes more than 1 min to connect to any number, such a slow crap device.  \nAmazon service not happy - they say return window got closed on 10th day of\npurchase. Now i've to run behind apple service centres...\n\n", "I like the product however after using for a few days I noticed that the\nbattery drains out rapidly, I found it little strange as I have been using the\nit's predecessor for quite a long time and initially it's battery life was\ngood and later it's gone worse after a usage of about 2 years However I just\nbought an iPhone 6 and I am really disappointed with the battery life.\n\n", "Awesome product.. working awesome..got product yesterday...it's absolutely\noriginal product and covers 1year full warranty. Thankyou amzone \ud83d\ude0a\n\n", "I got the apple iPhone 6 for my dad. He has been using this phone for a few\nmonths now and he absolutely loved the experience with it. iOS has always been\na great operating system and iPhone 6 is no slouch.\n\n", "Good phone. bought it in amazon festival sale 3 days back. delivery is prompt.\nmanufactured in September 2017. low price of 20999+ cashback.  \n  \nso far phone is good without any issues.\n\n", "Looks like a refurbished product as I found lot of other numbers already in\nthe phone , I hope this isn\u2019t repeated then I would not choose to buy and\nencourage others to do the same! Thanks\n\n", "Everything is perfect. Never expected this product to be that much good .\nActually , it breaks all my stereotypes regarding online product shopping via\nonline payment. Only thing lags is , my earphones might be not good but it\nsupposed to be product fault nothing to relate with online buying and\nshipment. Go for online shopping freely. Kudos.\n\n", "I am using since 1 Week, Its working Great and there no issue with the mobile\neverything is fine . Love the camera Quality & yeah IOS 11.0.2 Working smooth\non this better than any android mobile. I am Andriod user from long time. But\ni am loving IOS more.  \nCharging took around 1H30M something. Normal Use more than 1 day , Heavy use\nyou need to charge 2 times a day. I Bought it for 21k.\n\n", "Well what to mention about iphone 6. It is original product, delivered a bit\nlate but in perfectly boxed condition.
