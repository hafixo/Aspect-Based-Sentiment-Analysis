So Finding Perfect phone now a days is absolutely myth ...\nPros : -\n1) Very light weighted and Very much trendy looking phones specially backside of this handset is absolutely fantastic and Very smooth...\n2) Camera picture capturing quality is excellent and remarkable. Front Camera quality is also pretty muth satisfactory. Rear Camera quality is absolutely Fabulous and Mind blowing...\n3) 3 GB RAM is more then sufficient according to my point of view but it's may varying from person to person...\n4) Internal Free memory around 25 Gb, which is pretty much sufficient for me...\n5) Power of Flash light is also Very High...\n6) Fingerprint Senser is working in Very Fast mode...\n7) Most importantly, turbo charging facility of moto G4 plus is Very much fast and Totally impressive. Because, if you charge your phone after completing switch off your device, it may takes maximum 45 minutes to chrage 100 percent....\nCons : - \n1) This phone has one biggest issue called over heating issues...\nIf continously using it's camera, around 8 to 10 minutes then , the phone starts to get too hot and sometimes you feel too scared to hold this phone in your Palm....\n2) if you are a Heavy Gammer then this phone is not suitable for you, because after playing 8 to 10 minutes of playing any kind of games whether racing or Action whatever, this phone getting too hot and sometimes it's will reaches around 44 degree celceuis....\n3) During Turbo Charging, this phone starts to get Hoting , but after reaching around 65 percent of battery the temparature will gradually decreasing....\nSo don't get scary about this....\nOtherwise for general pupose user like me this phone is best in this price range...\nOverall I am totally satisfied after using 10 days from the date of receiving....", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "22 May, 2017", "reviewer": "Anaranya Biswas"},
