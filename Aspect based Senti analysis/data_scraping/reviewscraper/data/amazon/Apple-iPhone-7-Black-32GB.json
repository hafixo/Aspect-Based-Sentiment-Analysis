IMEI number should match with the bill and box\nprovided. .  \n2)to be on a safer side take a video while unboxing. (There have been cases of\npeople not getting their money back even after they getting a different\nproduct ).  \n3)check all the features of the phone that includes  \na) is it able to read the SIM card ?  \nb) look for any scratches or damage/crack on your screen  \nc) check the camera ( both front and back )  \nd) fingerprint scan should be working properly  \ne) is it able to record your voice and activate SIRI?  \nf) call your family member and check the function of the speaker and\nmicrophone  \ng) other minor things to check - FaceTime,iMessage,wifi , mobile internet /4g\n,Phone speaker,etc  \nh)check the volume buttons and the earphone jack which is defective a lot of\ntimes when you buy online  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________  \nWhich iPHONE 7 to buy ? 32GB V/S 128GB V/S 256GB?  \n  \nthe difference between the iPHONE 7 - 32GB(45,990Rs) ,128GB(56,999Rs) & 256\nGB(62,998Rs) is the PRICE and STORAGE capacity  \n  \nADVICE: iCLOUD is providing 5GB of FREE storage.  \nIF you want ADDITIONAL STORAGE the pricing is as follows :  \n>>>50GB- Rs 75/month . PER YEAR it comes to 75*12=900Rs(for 1 year\n)...1,800Rs(for 2 years)...2,700Rs (for 3 years)  \n  \n>>>200 GB- Rs220/month. PER YEAR it comes to 220*12=2,640Rs(for 1 year\n)...5,280Rs(for 2 years )...7,920Rs(for 3 years )  \n  \n>>>2TB- Rs 750/month. PER YEAR it comes to 750*12=9,000Rs(for 1 year\n)...18,000Rs(for 2 years )...27,000Rs(for 3 years )  \n  \nIF YOU WANT ADDITIONAL STORAGE GO FOR THE 32GB iPHONE 7 and buy the iCLOUD\nplan accordingly. YOU WILL END UP SAVING A LOT OF MONEY .  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________  \nINSURANCE FOR YOUR IPHONE?  \nYes it is always good to have insurance for your iPhone. (My brother lost his\niPhone 7 Plus 128 gb during ganpati visarjan but got 45K back due to\ninsurance.)  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________  \nIPHONE 7 V/S IPHONE 8 . WHAT TO BUY ?  \nIf you already have an iPhone 7 there is no point wasting money for the iPhone\n8 . You may wait for the iPhone 10.  \nIf you compare iPhone 7 and 8 the iPhone 8 is just going to be a bit faster\nthan the older iPhone 7. Lot more processing ,opens faster and faster gaming\nthan iPhone 7. No major changes to get excited about .  \nPrices of the iPhone 7 and 7 plus have come down drastically and I would\nrecommend going for the 7/7plus . If you have the money and are willing to\nwait then you can go for the iPhone 10.  \n  \nNOTE: will update my review after unboxing iPhone 8 and 10.  \n  \n**********UPDATE (8th OCTOBER 2017)************  \nApple investigates reports iPhone 8 Plus batteries BURST OPEN while phone\ncharges. After this news I feel that people should not buy the new iPhone\n8/8plus and iPhone X till this matter is solved .  \nWill KEEP on UPDATING.............\n\n", "Feel cheated.  \nThe product has failed in just a month.  \nphone is not getting charged above 4%.  \nThis is within approximately a month from the date of purchase\n\n", "Mane z balck color ka order diya the  \nDelivery me white and golad coloar aya he muje balck coloar ka chiye\n\n", "Earpods with lightning connector, lightning to headphone jack adapter not\nfound\n\n", "Amazing as expected\n\n", "Very Good.\n\n", "Good keep using it but needs to know more about warranty\n\n", "Amazing phone, sleek body. pleasure to hold the phone.\n\n", "Before time delivery and the trust of apple..\n\n", "Good phone at this price.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 29 September 2017", "on 8 January 2018", "on 9 January 2018", "on 2 January 2018", "on 27 December 2017", "on 17 December 2017", "on 22 December 2017", "on 8 January 2018", "on 7 January 2018", "on 26 December 2017"], "reviewer": ["Dr Chail Shah", "Ankan S.", "madan malviya", "Tanya chahal", "Shalini", "Amazon Customer", "Albin kuriakose ", "Ayub Shaikh", "vikash yadav", "Lalit Manek"]},
