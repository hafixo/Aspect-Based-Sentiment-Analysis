I had been using the 16 GB version of iPhone 6 since\na year and the less capacity of 16 GB made my phone memory full most of the\ntime. Thats when apple released the 32 GB version for around 28k and I was\nattracted to that. I gave off my 16 GB iPhone to my mother and I started using\nthe 32 GB one. Its been around 7 months of using the new 32 GB iphone, but one\nthing i found out was my old 16 GB version is much faster that than 32 GB\nversion ! The difference is easily noticeable when I use my new 32 GB and my\nold 16 GB phone back to back. The 16 GB one opens the apps very fast and is\nvery quick to respond. But my new 32 GB phone has a lag when opening apps and\nswitching apps. I thought this was an issue with my specific phone. Last month\nmy wife also bought a 32 GB gold iphone 6 and it also is slower. I think apple\nhas made some compromises in the hardware to bring the cost down in the new 32\nGB versions. Im disappointed with this.\n\n", "I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to buy a i phone online. Better buy it through an\nAuthorized Premium Dealer over the counter, even its for a higher price.\nBought this phone in exchange to my old I phone 6. It\u2019s been giving problems\nfrom day one. Intermittently the touch doesn\u2019t respond, message through the\ncontacts doesn\u2019t function properly and many more. I got to know that the\nlatest I phone bought online have many issues.
