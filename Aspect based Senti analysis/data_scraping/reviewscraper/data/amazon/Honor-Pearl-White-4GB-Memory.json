You'll\ndefinitely want a case - if you want to retain the look, gp for a transparent\ncase.  \n  \nThe software (Android with EMUI) is where things fall apart - EMUI is badly\ndesigned. It can't decide whether it wants to keep an andeoid feel or rip off\niOS look, and ends up doing neither. Probably it combines the worst of both\nworlds. After spending some time uninstalling bloated apps and disabling a lot\nof huwaei \"features\", the phone became a little useable.

It is beast in terms of processing.  \nAt a price range of under 25000 phones, you can surely go for this phone in\nterms of processing speeds and cameras. The cameras capture better and real ti\nlife colours. It is better than iphone 6s in terms of colour capture.  \n3\\. The build quality is excellent. It is surely the most beautiful phone\nunder Rs.30000 category.  \n4\\. The EMUI. It is a very powerful UI. Gives access to a lot of\nfunctionality.  \n5\\. The fingerprint sensor. Honor might have the most customisable fingerprint\nsensor. It very fast and a lot of features are embedded in it.  \n6\\. Its Full HD display is crisp.  \n7\\. The IR blaster. You can control a huge amount of devices.  \n  \nCONS:  \n1\\. There is no gorilla glass.  \n2\\. The videography is not good.  \n3\\. No earphones provided by honor.  \n4\\. No larger storage variant available.  \n5\\. The display's brightness is less than other phones. This creates a problem\nwhen using phone in sunlight.  \n6\\.

Since it uses both sensor while taking photos you\nget good contrast and details. (Good for astro photography even though you\nhave f2.2)  \nGood processor- Kirin 950 has never let me down. I never had any lagg or frame\ndrops while playing games. Yet.  \nLooks- The Sapphire blue varient (only) has that amazing trippy flash finish\nwhich turns a lot of heads. The gold varient has a more brushed glass\nfinished.  \n  \nCons  \nBattery life - Well it's hard for me(heavy user) to get through a day with\nsingle charge. My brother has the same phone but doesn't use much and has no\nproblem.(it loses 1-2% if kept overnight).  \nOS- EMUI is nothing to brag about. They are trying to copy IOS but I would\nrecommend you to change the launcher as soon as you get this phone.  \nHeating- It gets warm sometimes too warm for my linking. Never lags like I\nmentioned before but if you are paying money to buy something so beautiful you\nwouldn't want it to do this.  \nDouble glass=brittle- I never dropped it but I already have few minor\nscratches.

If u want fast charger. U want buy it separately.  \nIts a camera centric mobile. So if ur interested in photography u go for it.\n\n", "Used for about a month and bought for 14999 under honor sale. Read the\ncomplete review for better understanding of this smartphone.  \n  \n##Display##\ud83d\udcf1  \nThe display is quite gud, A 5.2inch LED screen with 443ppi pixel density gives\nu fab colors.  \nRich color phenomenon and also neutral temperature screen.  \n  \n##Battery##\ud83d\udd0b  \nLittle disappointing since it gives only about 6-7Hrs Screen On Time with\nmedium usage.  \nAnd for heavy usage it gives about 4-5Hrs SOT.  \nIn simple terms, you'll be getting about a half day of heavy usage with this.  \n  \n##Processor##\ud83d\udcbb  \nThis smartphone uses a huawei made SoC, kirin.  \nNow from prospective of a gamer, the octa core processor with 16nm\narchitecture and a 4GB RAM it's a beast that needs to be unleashed.  \nYou'll feel no lag either with multitasking or playing games.  \n  \n##Camera## \ud83d\udcf7  \nWhat can u say about a rear Dual camera of (12+12mp). Well that's correct it\nproved that it's still the best under \"Top smartphones with good camera under\n20k\". U get good options like monocolor, moving picture, time lapse, document\nand a lot more.  \nIt features a dual temperature LED flash.  \nThe front camera is decent of 8MP still gives a tough fight to Mi A1.  \nU can also use your voice to capture pics ;)  \n  \n##Design##\ud83d\udcf1  \nThis is a superlight smartphone if u compare it with the others in this price\nsegment including MI A1.  \nGiving a super sleek 7.6mm thickness and an aluminum coating on the edges. It\nfeels gud to hold the phone.  \nThe back glass can get fingerprint smudged easily but u can swipe it believe\nme and it still looks new.  \nIt's a little slippery so try a case(Go for Flipkart Smartbuy cases rough and\ntough and cheap as well)  \n  \n##Updates##\ud83d\udcf2  \nIf u buy this smartphone you'll get Nougat Update Android 7.0 with EMUI 5.1\nINSTANTLY  \nAlso in the forums it's mentioned that Honor 8 will get Oreo Update after\nrolling updates for Honor flagships smartphones.  \n  \n##Music and Audio quality##\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfb6  \nComing from a Sony smartphone I dont get something extra ordinary from this.\nBut still you'll get used to it soon.  \nThe ringtone comes loud enough so that u can hear it from sitting in another\nroom as well.  \n  \n##Security##\ud83d\udcf5  \nWhat u need when u have a fingerprint scanner right? Well this uses a 0.4s\nunlocking ability,  \nthats just in a blink of an eye.  \nIt has new and a cool applock feature installed in it. You can also use A SAFE\nfor hiding files.  \n  \n##Warranty##\ud83d\udd04  \n2years of manufacturer warranty along with 90days of screen replacement\nwarranty with VIP service.  \n  \n##Charging##\ud83d\udd0c\ud83d\udd0b  \nThe charger given in the box is a 5V/2A USB type C fast charger. This will\ntake 2hrs to charge honor 8 from 0% to 100%  \nU can also use qualcomm charger for smart and fast charging.  \n  \n##MAIN CONS U WILL NOTICE IN A WEEK##\ud83d\udcc8  \n1.The honor 8 heats up near the camera portion when u use the camera for 2-3\nmins.  \n2.Also when u play heavy games it'll heat up a little bit.  \n3.Battery discharging rate is not appreciated. 50% battery gone in 2-3hrs\nonly.  \n4\\. Less bass and more of trebble when using earphones (Even in senheisser\ncx180)  \n5\\. Nowadays when most people are having a sim for calling and one jio sim\ncard for data.  \nIt provides a single sim functionality which is disappointing.  \n6\\. Internal memory is only 32GB whereas other smartphones are giving 64GB in\nthis price segment.  \n  \n###OVERALL VERDICT###  \nOfcourse A coin has two sides. So if there is something gud with honor 8,\nthere are some glitches as well.  \nBut its a really gud option comparing to Redmi.  \nBelieve me you won't be disappointed much using this. It's a beast you just\nhave to learn to control it. \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\udc4d  \n  \nIf u lyk my review then hit the LIKE button and\n\n", "Rear Camera is just Superb!!  \nGreat night photos  \nDay photos are like dslr quality  \nUpdated to nougat immediately  \ncrystal clear sound both receiver as well as speaker  \nGreat Gaming experience  \nFluidic Ram Management  \nNo hanging issues  \nBattery Charges fully in just 2.5hrs  \nlasts 1 day even on Jio 4g  \nFront Camera is also great  \nGreat Colour  \nProblem is one sim only but its fine  \nSmooth and Fluidic Classic Phone\n\n", "Have never used an android phone apart from the major brands - samsung, lg ,\nmotorolla etc, so was a little hesitant before i purchasing.
