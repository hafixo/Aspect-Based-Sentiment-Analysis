Many performance lags and issues while working.\n\n", "Have been using the phone for littlebover a month now. Following are my\nobservations :  \n  \n1\\. Easy to hold and type  \n2\\. Sturdy & well built  \n3\\. Hasn't hung even once yet  \n4\\. External storage support comes in handy  \n5\\. Very decent battery performance  \n6\\. Feels like a business phone  \n7\\. Slim and light weight  \n8\\. The only grouse i have is about the stylus... Or probably i haven't\nexplored it thoroughly yet  \n  \nExtreme value for money product. LG has done it again.\n\n", "Don't buy this mobile. Within 6month i spent 3000 rs additionally for this\nmobile for it's mother board. Please do not waste ur hard money. Company is\nsaying gorilla screen but it does not resist minimum damage. My mobile fallen\ndown from Tea table and now screen is almost 2 pieces. I believed LG band and\npuchased from a show room with higher price than online. But quality of this\nproduct is very bad especially build quality. Please do not buy it with high\nprice. Better mobile will get cheap rate than this stylus. With my own\nexperience I suggest you guys do not opt this mobile.\n\n", "I had an option of buying from countless Chinese phones in less money. But I\nchoose to buy LG because it is reliable, no or seldom heating, no hanging,\nbeautiful pictures and front cam without any flash captures better images than\nmany other phones with front flash. the phone is very light and easy to handle\n& grip. I got many compliments that the phone looks classy. If you don't mind\ngiving up a little extra money for good value, this phone is for you.\n\n", "I am using this phone for last 6 months. Good battery. Camera quality is too\ngood on HDR. No hang. I played 4k video from Bahubali movie. Both sim slot\nsupports 4g volte. And also removable battery and dedicated SD card slot.\nUnfortunately no screen mirroring. Only 16gb internal but you can expand upto\n2tb. Knock unlock is a good feature.

However apps can be moved to SD card , the Google's\nones dont move..While at least more than half of the others do..So some kind\nof redemption there  \nEdit-90% of all the apps can be moved to SD card..I have 138 apps in total on\nmy phone in total including all system apps and installed apps and still have\nabout 1.2 GB odd free(so you can have an idea)  \n  \n4.the double tap to sleep and double tap to wake up is the best feature\never...Why doesn't google implement it into its android O.S???!!!  \n  \n5.even though the phone has an all plastic build,it still manages to look\npremium and feels sturdy.and it's a pretty sleek phone even with the 3200 mah\npowered battery and is surprisingly light too  \nThe bundled cover which comes in-box is unfortunately ugly..I mean..Whats an\nelephant doing on the front of my cover??!!!  \n  \n6.if stylus is your primary reason to get a phone and you are on a budget..LG\nstylus 3 is near PERFECT  \n  \nEdit- after a month of usage..I should say I'm in love with the LG stylus 3\neven though I'm coming from the legendary Redmi note 3 I have no complaints, I\nthink I'm satisfied (btw LG stylus 3 PLUS is around the corner)..and as for\nother phones with better specs in the same price range..they don't have an\nactive stylus (it costs more) so obviously they'll have better specs...and\nMotorola has already proved with their G and E series that specs is not\neverything,it's the experience that counts...and please don't compare to the\nSamsung Notes ..Samsung Note is a flagship device..this is a mid range budget\nphone.\n\n", "Awesome phone....\n\n", "more than six months since bought. here goes my honest opinion  \n  \nBattery usage- I leave my data on always and listens to youtube for an hour or\ntwo. phone calls minimal. 30m of browsing..End of the day battery is almost\nexhausted. 2-3stars rating only. LG listen!!!  \n  \nAudio- the speaker sound output is poor. while you are driving even if speaker\nis turned on the audio is very low. cant hear under normal outdoor noisy\ncondition. While watching movies or you tube sound is just enough for a small\nroom. Worth 2 to 3 star max. LG listen!!!  \n  \nScreen resolution is alright - 5 stars  \n  \nOutdoor screen visibility - in proper sunlight the phone is useless. Even with\nfull brightness cannot read the contents.. LG listen!!! 2 star.  \n  \nSupplied headset is poor quality- 3 stars  \n  \nOne fall with the supplied case from about 70cm I got a permanent yellow mark\nfull length on the screen.:(  \n  \nNow the plus points:  \ntwo window screen is a good choice. can watch you tube while browsing with\nhalf screen. 4 stars  \n  \nOverall - 2 star.  \nFrom a non Chinese established Phone maker I expect more solid phone and more\nfeatures.\n\n", "Amazing phone in medium price Good features  \n1-Camera quality but not best in night  \n2-Android 7.0  \n3-3Gb ram,phone not hanged  \n4-Stylus pen,fingerprint sensor  \n5-3200 mah powerful battery  \n6-big 5.7 inch screen,screen resolution good  \n7-3 Home option and you changed themes  \nBad features  \n1-Not led front flash  \nEverything good,I am very satisfied this phone\n\n", "It is wonderful phone. The screen clarity is very nice, though not FHD. Camera\nquality is good, in night or low light the image is not so clear. The battery\nback may last long for whole day with full usage. The performance of the phone\nis excellent and it never hangs. Pop Scanner and Quick Memo facility with pen\nmake this phone awsome and much much useful for those who go for business\npurpose. Qslide is very useful feature with this phone where you can play\nvideo, open phone screen and at the same time other apps also continue to\nwork. The look of the phone is elegant and quite slim. Overall, superb phone.\n\n", "Am thinking of buying this so went to brandstore. As per my Hands on\nexperience Stylus 3 was an awesome mobile and worthy upgrade to stylus 2.\nCamera & stylus is the main USP for this mobile. Camera is very good in my\nopinion. LG upgraded the stylus and ram management too is good(1.8 GB free).\nGo for it.  \nHD display is huge disappointment but believe me it's better than that cheap\nvivo model at 20000 rupees. Better viewing angles. If u still have any doubts\nor won't believe me go for LG brandstore and experience it.
