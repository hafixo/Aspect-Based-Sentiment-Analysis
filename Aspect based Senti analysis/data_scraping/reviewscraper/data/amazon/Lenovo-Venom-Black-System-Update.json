Battery backup: Not good. But not bad either. Goes 12hrs on high usage.\nScreen and data seemed to be the most consuming. And battery drain when idle\nis also another issue. Fast charge is only fast when you are not using your\nphone. Else it becomes like normal charger. However with the last update this\ncharging seems to have been improved. No conclusive results though.  \n2\\. Camera: Great in well lit conditions. Not so great in low light. However\ndual camera blur mode seems to be lacking in clarity and effetiveness.  \n3\\. Processor: Great but sometimes I face lags. Dont know what is the reason\nbehind it. But its not that the game stops for a few seconds. Its just for a\nfraction of a second. But you will be able to notice it.  \n4\\. RAM: Multitasking has no hindrance. Switching between apps is very fast.  \n  \nOverall I like the phone. And I expect that most of the issues we are facing\ncan and probably will be removed with software updates. So.. am satisfied with\nthe product.  \nIf you wish for longer battery life. Just use Greenify. And give it all the\npermissions that you can. It works like a charm.\n\n", "Not satisfied by this phone. Not as per expectations.  \n\\- Heats a lot (curtosy: Mediatek processor)  \n\\- battery life isn't great (doesn't even last a complete day on average\nusage, keeps draining quickly even on standby - I don't have many power\nintensive apps)  \n\\- not very ergnomic to hold. The corners are very sharp.  \n\\- camera is ok-ok. Dual camera (depth mode) isn't precise. While recording\nvideos, I have noticed the lens is focusing multiple times.. and as a result\nit keeps blurring and focusing giving a poor outcome video when u see the\nvideo again later.  \n\\- visibility under sunlight is not that great. Brightness is generally less.\nIf u increase brightness means it consumes more power.  \n\\- takes a long long time to charge. Wonder why they call turbo charging.  \n\\- I noticed some issue with my handset, not sure if it's common across Lenovo\nK8 note. Although there are 2 speakers, left ones is very weak. The right\nspeaker is strong and loud.  \n  \nI wouldn't recommend this phone, especially when there are good phones in\nprice bracket. Moto g5s plus is much better choice - even if it means spending\nfew bucks extra.\n\n", "Phone ok..  \nPros  \n4gb ram 64gb internal space both camera s are also good..selfie with flash  \nCons  \nDifficult to get tempered glass 2.5d screen  \nBrightness is little less  \nBluetooth play back music stucks if we use multiple apps same time also mobile\ndata on  \nSome moments phone hangs so i restart it..  \nEar piece volume for calling is less specialy if outdoor its difficult to\nhear..  \nPhone is ok..\n\n", "I am using this phone and didn't see any issue with it.  \nFast charging  \nBattery backup is nice.  \nBack camera is good in good light. Takes average photo in night.  \nFrom camera is great.  \nProcessor is good.  \nHeating is not much.  \nPhone is really like Samsung note in size.  \nFingerprint sensor is fast.  \nIPS screen is smooth.  \nDidn't see any issue mentioned by others in reviews.  \nSo go for it.\n\n", "Lenovo K8 note is above from any other sub15k range smartphones from lenovo\nbut average in overall ratings. And little bit of heavy .  \n  \nlill bit of heating with continues usage .  \n  \ncamera department is above of any other smartphones of this range but\nexception is it's dual camera setup which is only a hardware setup in\nsmartphone but software is not that much supportive wuth dual camera setup.\nFront flash is soft and quite good.  \n  \nStock android is impressive with it.  \n  \nProcessor is not battery efficient as 4000mah not last long for a day. 4000mah\nbattery is good on paper but in day to day life it is somewhere 3200mah.  \n  \nBuild and looks are impressive.  \n  \nLED notification light is point to consider.  \n  \nConsidering K8 note as a multimedia smartphone is fare ti rate it. Sound\nQuality is good display experience is also good as well.  \n  \nDual Sim and dedicated SD card slot is nice effort with the fone.  \n  \nDedicated music key is Good to have and ability to enable it for various\noperations is appreciabl.  \n  \nFingerprint security is only upto lock unlock but you can't let it to secure\nany of your apps without any 3rd party apps. yes it works in capturing\npictures through camera.  \n  \nStock android is that much basic that even you can't hide apps in app drawer.\nIt looks good but feels little less that even yiu can't hide unnecessary apps.\n\n", "After 2 month use found some problems  \n1\\. Brightness shaken like some time gets low and high (not running under auto\nbrightness)  \n2\\. During calls sometimes screen not locked other functions are getting\nclicked.  \n3\\. Bockeh effect is not good as expected . Can not judge the subject. Get\nbulr the subject also.  \n4\\. Heating problem is there while using Bluetooth and internet\nsimultaneously.  \n5\\. No gallary other playstore gallery's are too good.  \n6\\. Not a gaming phone sometimes hangs.  \n7\\. Hanging issues while starting and running applications also. Cannot do\nanything because battery is fixed non removable.  \n8\\. Many functions not working like screen casting cannot detect my smart TV\nand usb cable not detected in PC.  \n9\\. Automatic voice call recorder not works in this phone . only one app works\nwhich is paid rs. 650.  \n  \nOverall 3 stars as per price and fuctions\n\n", "Pros - good feel on hand ,screen 5.5inc.good and bright , battery changes in\naround 2hrs. Selfie flash and camera good.  \nCons -primary camera (dual camera) takes decent picture but depth enable\noption ON makes things bad .  \n  \nCompared with Redmi 4 note - for camera and K8 not able to match.  \nK4 - old product had dual speaker but this have 2 slots but only single\nspeaker.

The build quality is nice..though it weighs 180 gms it's not that much\nheavy.. adds a premium feel to the phone  \n2\\. The 2.5 curved glass + Corning gorilla glass 3 looks stunning..no\nscratches so far..the display of this phone impressed me a lot  \n3\\. The power and volume buttons are placed nicely + a dedicated music button\nworks brilliantly..since we can customize the music key  \n4.Fingerprint sensor is very quick also you can add up to 5 finger\nsamples..that's nice  \n5\\. The front camera is superb with flash..infact best front camera in this\nsegment  \n6\\. Rear camera is good but the bokeh mode is not good..bokeh looks\nartificial..when comparing with xiaomi mi a1's depth mode this phone is\nnothing but there is a depth mode editor where you can adjust the blur amount\nand many more..slow motion recording is pathetic..the rear camera is ok but\ndepth mode is horrible  \n7\\. Meditek hello x23 is very powerful when opening heavy apps..it can beat\nSnapdragon 625 but when opening light apps it loses out .The GPU Mali T880\nperforms well  \n8.The 4000 mah battery is the other con of this device..it won't last long if\nyou are a heavy user..the deca core cpu consume a lot.. for heavy user it will\nlast up to. 6hrs  \n9.The 15 W turbocharger can charge the phone in about 1 hr 45 min..which is\ngood  \n10\\. The stock Android is nice..but you cannot set additional ringtones or\ncannot see the battery percentage or call recording feature but you can set\nthem using various other apps and by using developer option.  \n11.Like lenovo's other phones this phone also gets heated up quickly..\nespecially when data turned on.. while using camera and hotspot..my phone's\nmax temp is around 44 degree  \n12\\. The Dolby Atmos is fabulous when using earphones..this phone is having\nmonospeaker  \nThe Lenovo k8 note is a great phone..it's having pros and cons when comparing\nwith other competitors.. comparing with mi a1 ..this phone loses out in the\ncamera department and timely updates from google , IR blaster, no heating\nwhereas this phone leads in many segments such as ..13 mp front camera with\nflash..Dolby Atmos..theatermax ..15w turbocharging..deca core processor..\ndedicated music button..and about 1000 rupees cheaper  \nThe camera problems of this phone can be fixed by an update  \nThus if you want these features go for it otherwise if you need a great back\ncamera choose mi a1\n\n", "First of all, don't compare this mobile with higher model. I'm sure it's far\nmore better than many other mobiles which are in same price category. I've\ndecided to write a review after using it for some days.  \nPros:  \nPrice of this mobile.  \nNo lag at all.  \nCamera is awesome if we've some patience. Even with DSLR we can't point &\nshoot the pictures instantly. If you are ready to spend some time to focus we\ncan get some gorgeous pictures to rock. Editing options are good for depth\nenabled photos. Front camera also gives good pictures.  \nScreen display quality improved over Lenovo K4 Note.  \n4GB RAM + 64GB ROM + Dedicated microSD card slot \ud83d\udc4doption. It's better to use\nnew or formatted SD card for optimum results.  \nHeat is acceptable ( not overheated ) - 4000Mah Battery \ud83d\udc4d.  \n  \nCons:  \nMobile is switched off while charging. It's a major issue to be solved in next\nupdate.  \nCPU management can be improved. Because it's a deca core.  \nFile management is some how difficult to pickup.  \n  \nGO FOR IT. LEARN IT. ENJOY MORE  \nIt's a best option for those who wanna buy a dual camera mobile first time.\n\n", "Revising my earlier review written about 4 months ago in which I gave 5 stars.  \nThe biggest problem is battery, which is getting worse with each system\nupdate. Its 4000 mah battery is worse than a contemporary similar phone with\n3000 mah battery. Something seriously wrong and the irony is no serious effort\nby Lenovo to rectify it. Barely after 4 months of the purchase, I have to\nrecharge the phone twice every day.

Display is way vibrant and better  \n2\\. Speaker is much audible, thanks to Dolby Atmos also  \n3\\. Camera both rear and front are Value for Money, while the depth field\ncamera is trickier sometimes ( Lenovo need to improve software to correct\nthese bugs )  \n4\\. Stock Android - Volaaaa!! Pretty much slick, faster!! No unnecessary apps.  \n5\\. Not faced heating use that other mentioned while using ( though not a\ngamer )  \n6\\. Turbo Charging - Best part for my case!  \n7\\. SD card option gives you more advantage than to compromise as hybrid SIM  \nCONS:  \n1\\. Its damn heavy - 180grams, pain on palm sometimes for myself!  \n2\\. Warms up a bit while charging alone ( i think maybe due to that turbo\ncharging )  \n3\\. Other Cons not yet identified, will Updage soon\n\n", "there was some jam or tightness in SD card slot  \nthe camera zoom is bit insufficient and low light is an issue  \nthe headphones jack and audio are sure not neat at all  \nthe day-light still camera, HD screen, WiFi reception, VoLTE Call Audio,  \nDolbyAtmos speaker, Android 7 Slim and Private, TV and Movie streaming,  \nFinger-print locks are all fine to good with me. Thanks to deca-core.  \nHad to use an app download for video recording - was good too.  \nNo regrets as the 10th day moves.\n\n", "Really nice product with all the specifications those we need in current days.  \n4GB/64GB, deca core, Android nougat  \n  \nRear dual Camera quality- is good but in comparison with Samsung's 13MP camera\nit is not that much.  \nFront camera is in acceptable level.  \nProcessing speed is brilliant by deca core.  \nDisplay quality, touch and figer print sensor are very good and fast.  \nDolby atmos makes multimedia experience very interesting.  \nBattery back up is sufficient for one and half days with moderate usage.  \nDisplay quality is excellent.  \nGorilla glass, splash proof and fast charging makes it value for money\nproduct.  \n  \nOrdered during great festival sale and amazon delivered this within 24 hrs...\n\"Amazon like Amazing\"\n\n", "My prev phone was Honor 6X and I was in love with that phone. Somehow I broke\nthat phone at home when I was in extreme anger, the new phone I ordered was an\nHonor 8 lite with an exchange offer. The order was cancelled coz my old Lenovo\nK3 note for exchange was not is a great condition. I am glad this happened and\nI finally ordered a Lenovo K8 note. I did not expect a Lenovo phone to be this\ngood! Smooth touch and swiping experience! Performance really great!\nAudio/Camera is great. Battery seems long lasting. Build quality is pretty\ngood.  \nEdit: Some good features like dedicated sd card slot, 4g+3g sims, Gorilla\nglass, music key, good external speakers.  \nI have installed Go launcher now which makes the touch experience as smooth as\nRedmi phones.\n\n", "Phone is awesome...  \nPerformance is also very good  \nCamera quality is good....  \nBattery is good..  \nBt phone has lack of function and features  \nLike we can't take long screenshot..  \nIt has no dual apps function like xiaomi devices  \nThere is no app locker given in the phone like Xiaomi devices  \nWe can't turn the phone silent easily...  \nWe can't change the theme of the phone\n\n", "I using this phone from 10th of jan it is not happy with performance of phone\n,it is getting hang every time ,amazone has arranged technician he has factory\nreset after also the phone is not working properly ,technician has committed\nthat if it not working properly then you will get new phone ,call center team\nis refusing that they have got a feedback that phone is working properly ,i\nhave ask for new phone the lady from call center said we cant replace the\nphone ,it is 18 to 20 days gone but phone is not working properly , i am\nunsatisfied customer of amazon on their commitment\n\n", "The phone is good for the price. Finger print reconginition us instant. You\ncan play games without any lag. Charges very quickly. Phone doesn't hang. The\ncamera is just ok. The selfie camera is decent. The only issue is that it\nheats up a bit during Charing but I think it is normal as it support fast\ncharging. Battery lasts 1.5 days will moderate usage. The back cover provide\nalong with the phone is slippery. Better to buy a proper cover.\n\n", "It's A Good product at this price.  \nOn first day I realised it has battery issues n phone is not getting charged\nbut since I charged with turbo charger it's like Wow n good charging n No\nheating issues as of now.  \nPhone is pretty smooth n Black looks classy.  \nLet's talk about Camera I was thinking to buy OP5 just bcz of Camera but\nbought this one so I thought it's good one if you know how to Click\nphotos.Depth mode has good options of Splash & Change Focus.  \nLow lights camera is Ok.  \n  \nI would be great If there were few features like night mode , slow motion ,\ntime lapse as honor 6X provides.  \n  \nIf these additional Camera functions would have added than this would be a Wow\nPhone. But at this range it's not a Bad Choice.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 19 October 2017", "on 24 September 2017", "on 6 September 2017", "on 30 August 2017", "on 28 September 2017", "on 29 September 2017", "on 17 September 2017", "on 30 January 2018", "on 27 August 2017", "on 13 September 2017"], "reviewer": ["Abhishek", "Pankaj", "Arun Ravi", "AK", "CA Jainendra Sahu", "Amazon Customer", "Rohit Sinha", "Maninder", "vinod", "Hitesh Sukhwani"]}
