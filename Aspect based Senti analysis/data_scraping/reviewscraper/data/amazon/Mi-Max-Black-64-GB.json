Only thing not so good is that it's\nnotification light has only one colour 'white'\n\n", "I bought this phone last month in the amazon sale on discounted price. Got a\nvery nice deal.  \n  \nRegarding the product:  \n  \nIts the best value for money phone you can buy if you like really big screen\nphones.  \nI wont talk about specs because you can already find them in the prouduct\ndespription. That said, specs are very good for the price in my opinion.  \n. Amazon delivery was very fast  \n.the phone is fast and fluid, no lags  \n.display is pretty awesome, media consumption is such a treat  \n.Battery is a BIG plus, backup is awesome and battery charges very fast  \n.Lots of customization options offered by MI UI which I really like  \n.Sound is awesome. Dual speakers.  \n.Camera is above average to good depending on lighting conditions. Should\nsuffice all your general photography needs.  \n.the phone has metallic built, feels very premium. One point to note here is\nthat the phone is sleek and doesn't feel bulky at all to me. Thats very nice\ndesign by Xiomi on such a big phone.  \n  \nJust remember, its a big phone, so dont expect it to be as handy as a small\none.\n\n", "Better than Redmi Note 4 .I was having a Redmi Note 4 and I accidentally broke\nit so I bought this and is much better than Redmi Note 4 in every aspect.it\nlike a better and refined Redmi Note 4 go for it if screen is not an issue.And\nyou will get used to it after using it for 1 week.Thank you\n\n", "Good Phone. Performs task without lagging. 4Gb RAM and 64Gb Internal is good\ncombination.  \nCharging cable has \"C\" type mobile connector.

My usage is high but it is nice and no\nneed to worry for charging daily.  \nWorking fine.  \nCamera is not so good.  \nScreen resolution is awesome.  \nsleek designed phone and budgeted phone.  \nBook reading is just like kindle.\n\n", "I have been using mine max from more than one year I fell in love with it then\nbought MI max 2 has all the most amazing features  \nFeatures I love the most are  \nAmbient light sensor  \nStereo speakers surround sound  \nBattery one of the major feature too too good  \nAnd the display so colorfull  \nSpace ram rom  \nAnd the color  \nBest mobiles I've ever used if your lukin for a best battery best display best\nperformance and luks go for it mi max 2 bigger is better\n\n", "I bought this Mi Max 2 - 64GB, during Diwali offers and got the best deals and\nnow after using this phone for one month now I\u2019m giving the feddback with few\npictures taken from my previous phone Redmi Note 3.  \n  \nBest Features:  \n  \nBig Screen with better wide-angle giving best viewing experience while reading\nor watching video.  \n  \nDual speakers with stereo effect give a good surround sound music experience\nin landscape mode.  \n  \nSplit screen mode is very useful for various apps (It works only when updated\nwith MIUI 9).  \n  \nTwo-day battery life despite use with all-day mobile data on, Bluetooth keep\nconnected with \u00a0Mi Fit Band, 1-3 hours YouTube play and 1-hour song listening.  \n  \nCamera Quality is good thanks to Sony IMX386 sensor with better lens. Though,\nin low-light picture quality is not satisfying but still better than Redmi\nNote 3 & 4.  \n  \nWith 4GB RAM and 2 GHz Octa-core processer I have not yet faced any issues of\nslow performance or hanging while using multiple apps at a time.  \n  \nDownsides:  \n  \nThe drawback is when you protect phone with a back cover it becomes difficult\nto hold in hand especially while talking on voice call for longer time, hence\nit is not for small hands. But when becomes habitual it is easy to handle and\nyou will don\u2019t like other smaller screen size phones.  \n  \nAnd one thing more, after updating to MIUI 9 I\u2019m getting an unknown error\nmessage for reporting, but I hope within next updates it will be fixed by MIUI\ndeveloper team.\n\n", "Purchase the mi max2 after going through the reviews of previous purchasers\nand thought of laying my hand on the beast and found it very outstanding true\nto its standard. I have been using lenovo phab2 a bodily beast and in\ncomparison mi max2 is both bodily as well as performance beast. Thanks amazon.\n\n", "Pros:  \nBattery life- Lasts more than 2 days easily.  \nScreen- Big screen. A joy to watch football matches, movies & for playing\ngames.  \n  \nCons:  \nScreen- Really bad viewing angles. Shouldn't bother you unless two or more\npeople are watching movie on its screen.  \n  \nCamera- Didn't expect it to be better than my MI5 and I was right. Camera is\nmediocre. Go for maybe MI A1 if you want good camera but compromise on screen\nsize n battery life. Tough question, I went ahead with max 2 though.  \n  \nLoudspeaker- Expected better from a stereo loudspeaker but the sound from\nearpiece is neither bassy nor loud. So not better than a mono loudspeakers on\nother phones.  \n  \nOther than pros n cons. Some important things to note are:  \nSize- It's a huge device. I have a MI5 and wanted to have another phone whose\nbattery life is great and on which I can watch my football matches\n(hotstar/jioTv). So as a secondary phone, it's great. Doesn't fit in all of my\njeans. So sometimes I keep it in my office bag. If you know what you're\ngetting, you'll be fine.  \n  \nGiven around 13-15k, I'd make this choice again and buy max 2 just for the\nawesome battery life. I mean you can do whatever you want and not worry about\nthe battery getting empty. That's a big plus. So 5 star for me. Cheers\n\n", "Bought this for my wife. And boy isn't she glad to have it. Just love the\nclarity,speed ,camera quality and best of all super battery back up. Extremely\nhappy with the product and Amazon as usual ensured timely delivery.

I used my Amazon Prime account to stream\nvideo through my WiFi connection.  \n  \nIt has a non-removable massive 5300 mAh battery that I can personally say\nlasts about three days of normal use. This massive battery has a quick charge\nfeature which can charge it from 2% to 100%. I did that and can vouch for it.  \n  \nIts primary OS is Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) with a Qualcomm MSM8953 Snapdragon\n625 Chipset. The CPU is Octa-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A53 and its graphics\nprocessor is the powerful Adreno 506. All cutting edge here.  \n  \nThe camera features, though not very great, are pretty impressive. The primary\ncamera is 12 MP, f/2.2, phase detection with autofocus and dual-LED (dual\ntone) flash. Additional features include the 1/2.9\" sensor size, 1.25 \u00b5m pixel\nsize, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, panorama capebilities.  \n  \nOther Sensors include a fingerprint scanner in the back, an accelerometer, a\ngyro, a proximity sensor, a compass.  \n  \nLast but not least, it comes with Corning Gorilla glass-3 screen guard already\ninstalled for extra durability.  \n  \nAll in all, this is the best phone at this price. There is nothing else that\ncomes even close. I recommend this totally.\n\n", "Its Perfect Phone for Big Screen Lovers... and let me tell you one thing very\nclearly.. though it is 6.44' screen but is not that too much big... you can\neasily place in your Pocket I just love this phone... i bought it for My Mumma\nB'day Gift... she love it too becuz its easy to navigate in bigger screen for\nladies and persons who is not regular users of smartphone... apart from Big is\nBetter.... functioning is also awesome very fast 625 processor and 4 gb of ram\nand 506 Gpu make more convenient to use ....

Also, it supports Quick Charging. 0-100 in 1:46 hours for a 5300 Mah\nbattery is admirable.  \n  \nCons:  \nNone really except the size for some people but not for me.  \n  \nThank you Amazon for quick delivery and MI for such a fantastic product.\n\n", "Just today got the phone.

The battery on this will get you through 30 hrs .. even if\nyour watching videos or playing games . It's a steal for the buck. It's\ndefinitely big and and one hand use is too difficult. However while watching\nmovies or YouTube it's a delight. Perhaps with a larger hand it will be a bit\neasier. However sometimes the phone is not reachable even while there is full\nreception. And call quality is not great. And the user interface is not\nandroid so it will talk a while to getting used you. But at the price point\nit's the best one can buy if size is a concern but the Lenovo P2 or with for\nthe p3 that had similar spec at 5.5 inch screen. Cheers\n\n", "Very good product.

My prime requirement of mobile phone was\ninternal storage and battery life. Both these purposes are well served by Mi\nMax 2. The big screen is awesome for gaming, video, social media and reading.\nThe resolution is also great. SD625 processor along with 4GB RAM and 64GB\nstorage is an excellent combination which provides great performance for\ngaming as well as productivity purposes. I usually play casual games, but it\ncan handle most of the high end games without hassle.  \nThe 5300mAh battery is the real jewel of this device. I got almost 20 hours of\nscreen-on time on moderate use, including extensive web browsing and video\nplayback with 4G LTE continuous on. Even if you play high end games, you can\nget more than 12 hours of screen-on time. Fast charging is also excellent. It\ncharges from 60% to 100% in less than 20 minutes. Although I haven't tested,\nbut it can charge from 0% to 100% within 1.5 hours.  \nThe build quality is excellent with unibody metal design. The size is really\nbig. It may be difficult pocketing if you have tight jeans, but mostly it is\nmanageable. Also it is difficult to use it with one hand, specially when\ntyping, but one-handed-mode can be helpful in that case.  \nFingerprint scanner works great with almost no delay and great accuracy.\nScreen brightness and sunlight legibility is also excellent. Sound quality is\nalso superb, on both speakers and headphones via 3.5mm jack. However, it is\nnot bundled with headphones, but you can use any standard 3.5mm headphones.  \nCamera is above average. Daylight photos are excellent with great clarity and\ncolors, but indoor and low-light photos are little noisy. Front camera is also\ngood, it takes great selfie if lighting is adequate, but low light performance\nis just average. Video recording is also great for this price range, as it can\nrecord 4K videos, but it doesn't have OIS, so videos will have shaking effects\nif you don't have stable hands. I do not use mobile device for photography\nsignificantly, so camera cons are not a problem for me. But believe me, at\nthis price range, camera performance is more than good.  \nOverall, I fell in love with it in just a week of usage! If size is not a\nproblem for you, just grab it, you won't be disappointed!\n\n", "I had booked Mi Max2 on 1st December and got it delivered on 4th december\nbecause of Sunday I got it one day delay in delivery.I m using this mobile\nfrom last two days and I have just once charged it because of its big battery\nof 5300mah and to be honest it lives to its expectation.The camera quality is\ndecent not too good nor too bad and it gives decent result in natural light\nboth in image and video mode.The big screen is good and gives nice resolution\nand is visible in sunlight decently.The heating issue in this mobile is not\nfelt while charging,gaming,mobile hotspot or while screen mirroring as\ncompared to previous mobile like redmi 4a ,redmi4 or redmi note4. Its decent\nbuy for a customer who is looking for all features in this price bracket.\n\n", "Just received this phone 3 days ago. So writing the review of my experience\nabout the phone. I was very confused about to buy this phone. Because so many\nconfusing reviews were there about the phone. But after using it i am so\nsatisfied about the phone. The 16.4 cm (6.44) immersive display is really\nvibrant and huge. And that is the reason i bought it. Picture quality of\ncamera is awesome. Some reviews are there that camera is not so good. But i am\nnot agree with that opinion. Yes, camera is problematic in low light. There is\na need of betterment. Battery is also very good. This is second day of\ncharging and 62% battery is still remaining. I dont play game so cant say what\nshould be position of battery after playing games. Only thing I found bad, the\nquality of sound. Sound is loud but when i am increasing it, i think it's\ncracking. Back side of the phone is so smooth and slippery that you hardly can\nhold it in the palm. Otherwise the phone quality is overall superb.\n\n", "Phone looks good. Camera is fine. 64GB is great. Price is great.  \n  \nIt has micro and Nano SIM slots only. You can use one SIM only at a time if\nyou use micro SD. This is disappointing for me as it was not explained in\ndescription. Settings were too complicated as you can't find them easily. Not\nso simple like branded phones. Can't find software update in settings at all.\nI'm in two minds to keep it or not. I guess I get use to it. Overall good for\nthe price. Not the best.\n\n", "Excellent phone.  \nMy last phone was the Samsung J7, to which this phone is infinitely superior.  \nThe case is fully sealed with only a tray for the sim n SD card.  \nScreen size is large.

Bought from Amazon after\nhours of research, deliberation, and comparing the best budget mobile sections\nI came upon this gem of a phone. Prompt delivery but had an issue with double\ndebits while making payments which was reversed in a week after speaking to\nthe customer care. Mi Max 2 is bulky and makes it awkward for calls, but that\nis its only drawback. Excellent performance, good audio quality. Display is\nalso really crisp. Camera is a bit of a let down however, takes really good\nselfies & images. Browsing, downloading and on the go net speeds are\nexcellent. Works better than a laptop or pc. It's not a phone for everyone but\nthe best buy for all. Feature rich, great value and lots of optimization and\ncustomisation options. Excellent for watching videos and the big screen space\nadds to its value and makes typing easier. Currently its the best buy with 4GB\nRAM, 64GB storage, Android Nougat and well priced. The phone comes without\nheadphones, lacks extra storage expansion slot in case the user has 2 sims\ncards. It doesn't come with a screen guard or a phone cover however, it can be\neasily accessorised.

While taking selfie pictures also I don't find it a\nproblem coz the design is sleek and the pics can b taken with your fingerprint\non the bk... So the size is not an issue for me personally... But for some\npeople this could b a con...  \n2\\. Contacts list or phone list does not hv the option of seeing the\nfrequently called numbers like it did in my moto phone... So I miss that...\nBut it is not a big drawback...  \n  \nI can't think of any other cons... This phone is just amazing... Go for it...\nYou will not regret it...\n\n", "Very good phone for this rate. Thin and elegant. Once start using does not\nfeel big and to watch videos very good screen with clarity and pleasant. Xiomi\nis rocking. Amazon delivery was superb as usual.\n\n", "Above average product in performance. Too good if price comparison is\nconsidered, there is no better smartphone in the market of the same category\nand price range. Camera is not the cause of concern for normal user. Experts\ncan opt for costlier ones.But this is best on screen size, battery etc. A mini\nsd card slot would have been made as enough space available.\n\n", "I am taking out time to write review about this product because this phone has\nactually forced me to do so.  \n1\\. The EXCEPTIONAL Battery which lasts for 1.5 day with fair high usage.\nServers my purpose.  \n2\\. In this range of phones i must say it gives real good pictures to make you\nfall in love with yourself.  \n3\\. The big screen makes the vedios so attractive.  \n4\\. In built apps keep you away from unnecessary apps with lots of adds or\nbuying option to get rid of apps.  \n5\\. It has strong antenna which keeps to connected with your world even in low\ncoverage area.  \n6\\. Awesome look with so light weight metallic body.  \n7\\. Dual apps option for those who keep dual apps like WhatsApp.\n\n", "Packing was poor again by seller . Phone is excellent in some aspects .\nBattery life is INSANE. Fast charging is also a plus point . Performance is\nsmooth no heating issue as of now . Camera is average not good not bad . Some\ntimes it captures excellent image some time garbage ... Ram management is\nexcellent again... Very heavy UI takes almost 2.2GB of RAM (56%) . MIUI 9 IS\nfast as expected. Speakers are excellent screen quality is good viewing angle\ncould be better. Overall good value for money if u are not a camera centric\nuser ... If u need a good camera then avoid buying it.\n\n", "Screen is larger (6.44 inch) looks great. On other hand it is hard to operate\nwith one hand. But still its fine.  \n  \nIt has 5300mah battery. Last for 24-30 hours. If continuously work on wifi or\ninternet. Camera is fine great design, really fast.  \n  \n1 think i didn't like is.. it has hybrid sim. I cant use my mmc here because\nof second sim.\n\n", "Best value for money. Looks so cute. Other than camera quality problems, this\nis the best buy for every thing else. I bought mi Max and now max2. This is\nmore beautiful than earlier version\n\n", "The review is written after a month of usage. The phone seems to work fine but\ntoday I had an unexpected reboot. So, that is a little bothering.  \n  \nThe phone seems to run most apps smoothly (I have not tried the high end\ngames)  \n  \nThe size is something I wanted to be large and trust me, it is too big for a\nsingle hand usage.  \n  \nThe sounds and display are working well. The winning feature remains to be the\nbattery backup(almost two days)  \n  \nThe camera zoom and low light pictures are simply pathetic.\n\n", "Iam using mi max 2 for last 4 days, I am happy with the features available in\nthe mobile, All the mobiles like moto, lenovo, micromax are manufactured in\nChina but Chinese company xiaomi manufacturing all the mobiles in Sri city,in\nthe Tamil nadu- Andhra pradesh border but surprisingly my mobile is\nmanufactured in sriperumbudur near Chennai,I am very happy to use Indian\nproduct...\n\n", "Amazing phn.. Amazing batter backup.. Bit big bt easily fit in to jeans\npocket... Front Camera is disappointing... Bt watching movie, playing game or\noffic work is pleasure.. Ram is very fast and charging by typ c cable gives u\n1.30hours for full charge.. Display is owsum.. Jst bye it... U will luv once u\nget it... N battery is just suparb... Dnt think twice just buy it...\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 22 October 2017", "on 13 December 2017", "on 26 December 2017", "on 5 February 2018", "on 11 December 2017", "on 19 November 2017", "on 8 September 2017", "on 31 January 2018", "on 27 October 2017", "on 1 October 2017"], "reviewer": ["Palak Thakkar", "basheer", "Samir Samanta", "Amazon Customer", "gaurav khulbe", "vishal94kumar", "Jagan Reddy", "HIMANSHU", "G Vinoth Kumar", "Kunal sengupta, guwahati"]}
