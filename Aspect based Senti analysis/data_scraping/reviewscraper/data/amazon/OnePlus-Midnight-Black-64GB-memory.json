Best in performance... Camera is above average but u have\nall the ability to control the camera like iso, shutter speed and so on in the\npro mode which will bring out a great shot.... It is damn fast... All the\napplications you through on it, it can slice through easily. Face lock \"OMG\"\nIt's insanely fast... And the dash charger will quickly charge. I will keep my\nphone to charge in the morning the charge will be around 30% and when I come\nback it will be full, no need to worry about the battery life. It lasts me a\nday with one full charge.... Finally talking about the design and display...\nIt is very sleek and fits in the hand perfectly... When u hold the u can feel\nthe slimness of the phone.... It's that hot phone... With the 18:9 ratio\ndisplay it makes the phone perfect with it's price tag of 33k. Hence it is\ndamn good... The best phone... Especially for college students\n\n", "It's a very good mobile phone. Fast and good screen. Design is elegant. But..\nthe sound quality is poor for both inbuilt speaker and WiFi speaker. I've\ninstalled Dolby program but didn't change much. I hope this will be improved\nsoon.\n\n", "Best phone ever.. Screen looks fantastic and phone is a beast in performance.\n\n", "One plus is rocking\n\n", "No words to tell, awesome mobile thanku Amazon for launching this mobile\nthrough ur website \ud83d\ude0a\n\n", "Everything is nice except the look. Design is not up to the expectation for a\nphone cost 33k\n\n", "Received the product in a day..( I live in Bangalore )  \nUnlike the other boxes being damaged, mine was very good...  \n  \n***-Box contents-***  \n  \nBefore starting...  \nI would like (love) to say that the unboxing of this product is the\nbbbbbbbbest.....  \nYou will just LOVE the way they packed the things and... You'll just love\nit...  \n  \nSlowly opening the top box, we have our PHONE with the best look sitting there\nintact...  \n  \nUnder that we have quick start guide in a transparent phone case.. We can find\na coupon in the quick start guide..  \n  \nBellow that we have the dash charger and the USB type c wire.  \n  \n***-PHONE-***  \n  \n1.DISPLAY  \n  \nBELIEVE ME... you WILL LOVE this display..  \nThe THIN BEZELS make you feel goooood ( great )  \nYou will be given a pre-applied screen protector with  \nthe phone..  \n  \n2\\. SOUND  \n  \nThough it has a single speaker...the sound quality and the intensity is\ngreat..  \nBUT....  \nWhen you play a game or watching a video horizontally, you could be covering\nthe speaker and it is BAD....  \nYou can resolve this by using a headphone or rotating the screen the other way\naround...  \nHope this helps..  \n  \n3.BATTERY  \n  \nMmmmmm.....  \nBattery iiiiis goood  \nBUT.....  \nIf you're playing games intensively, then this could drain the battery....  \nBut nothing to worry..... It is only if you're a heavy gamer....  \n  \nAAAAAAND.......NOOW.....  \n  \nEven if you're an intense gamer....  \nDON'T WORRY....  \n  \nTHE DASH CHARGING IS THE FASTEST  \nIT IS SOO FAST....that it  \nCHARGED MY 9% battery to 94% in 23 minutes.....  \n  \nAnd  \n  \nTHE PHONE DOESN'T HEAT AT AAALL...  \nThough it gets a bit WARM ( If you know what warm means ) it doesn't bother at\nall...  \n  \nAnd tha AMAZING PART is that the DASH CHARGER doesn't heat a litttttttle bit\nalso....  \nPretty impressive I should say...  \n  \nWe can call this  \n***THE FLASH CHARGER***  \n  \nBUT.....  \n  \n4.CAMERA  \n  \nAs a photographer, I never liked portrait mode or depth mode on phones for one\nsingle reason....  \nThey make it look like they give a bokeh effect...  \nBut as the technology of these cameras are also changing, they're getting\nbetter at that artificial bokeh...  \n  \nOnePlus 5T has a second camera which has an aperture of f/1.7 which means it\ngives  \na) Very good looking bokeh effect  \nb) Allows more light... which means...  \nVERY GOOD IN LOW LIGHTING CONDITIONS  \n  \nBut OnePlus 5T's second camera is no longer dedicated for telephoto purpose...\nInstead, it uses the secondary camera for low lighting purposes and advanced\ndepth mode.  \n  \nThough it doesn't do that well in a), it EXCELLS in b)  \n  \nI've tested the camera in very low lighting areas and it is a very very very\ngood camera for low lighting photography...  \n  \nI'll be testing and updating this review again after a while...  \n  \n5.PERFORMANCE  \n  \n\\--------> BE(A)ST <\\--------  \n  \nGAMING...  \n  \nI've played some heavy games like  \nMortal kombat x  \nAsphalt 8  \nHitman sniper  \nModern Combat  \nN.O.V.A  \n....etc. (Please do suggest any other Heavy games I should test)  \nand it has  \n+NOOO FRAME DROP AT ALL  \n+DOESN't HEAT AT ALL  \n+SMOOOTH AND HIGHLY ENJOYABLE GAMEPLAY  \n  \n-BATTERY MIGHT DRAIN FAST...(DEPENDS)  \n-IF YOU'RE NOT USING HEADPHONE, YOU SHOULD HOLD THE PHONE ONLY IN ONE WAY TO LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF THE GAMES  \n  \nRAM MANAGEMENT AND SPEED  \n  \nEXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT  \n  \nDONE...  \n  \n6\\. FINGERPRINT SCANNER AND FACE ID  \n  \nSINGLE WORD FOR BOTH OF THEM...  \nFASTEST  \nThough the Face id takes time to set up....  \nIt is accurate and fast..  \nOne suggestion... Don't move your face too much when the phone is scanning\nyour face...  \nTry to look at the camera and stand in a place so that your face appears to be\nbright (under a light..etc.)  \n  \n*****************************************************  \n  \nI'll be updating this review again and cover all the aspects after testing and\nusing this phone for a while..  \n  \nTo avoid the battery drain..  \nDon't charge your phone upto 100%  \nAnd don't completely use it to 0%  \n  \nHope this review is helpful..  \nPlease do click the helpful option if this review was helpful..  \n  \nThanks.\n\n", "The best looks , Awesome Camera, Seriously is a flagship killer, Superfast\ncharging.\n\n", "Fantastic\n\n", "Lovely phone, worth the price and valuable.
