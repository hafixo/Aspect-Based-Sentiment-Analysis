Powered by the Qualcomm\nSnapdragon 435 Octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz and coupled with Adreno\n505 GPU, this phone comes in three memory variants:  \n  \n1) 2 GB RAM along with 16 GB internal storage  \n2) 3 GB RAM along with 32 GB internal storage  \n3) 4 GB RAM along with 64 GB internal storage.  \n  \nI haven\u2019t really encountered any sluggishness or lags using the second\nvariant. Smooth performance is delivered. The top spec's variant offers just\nthe right balance of performance at the price range.  \n  \nCamera:-  \n  \nOutdoor in daylight, the phone really gives us with details it manages to\ncapture and overall clarity.  \n  \nIn low light, the camera clicks some decent shots, but there\u2019s a lot of noise\nin the pictures.  \n  \nDisplay:-  \n  \nIt has a 5-inch HD display with a 1280 x 720 resolution. The images and text\nlooks sharp. In this price range its a great display although you will be\nmissing the Gorilla Glass.  \n  \nBattery:-  \n  \nA day and a half on a single charge is easily manageable on a normal use and a\nday of charge on a moderate to higher usage.  \n  \nSoftware:-  \n  \nIt runs MIUI 8 on top of Android Marshmallow out of the box. It's totally\ndifferent UI altogether than stock Android but you will get used to it after\nusing it for a while.  \n  \nXiaomi delivers another promising phone with a top spot in terms of sales at\nthis price range. If you\u2019re planning to pick up a budget smartphone right now,\nit\u2019s hard to look further than Redmi 4. Just go for it.  \n  \nI was tight on budget and hence bought the second variant, but if you can up\nyour budget by \u20b91000, the top spec's variant at \u20b99,499 is the best pick of the\nthree since it offers just the right balance of performance and price.  \n  \nProduct Rating:- 4.5/5 (Cannot select 4.5 stars though)\n\n", "Got this phone for an effective price of Rs.6750 during Amazon festival sale\n(exchanged old . Motorola 3g phone + cash back + discount). Phone has really\ngood specs for the price - 4 gb RAM and 64 gb storage.  \n  \nWhat I like about it :-  \n1) good ram and storage  \n2) features like Infrared sensor (works well as remote with my Sony smart TV\nand Hathway settop box) and wireless display.  \n3) manageable size - not too big for pocket  \n4) features like automatic call recording means one doesn't have to install\nseparate call recorder  \n  \nWhat I didn't like :-  \n1) over -heating especially when charging with data transfer or watching\nvideos  \n2) MIUI is unnecessarily complicated and one has to struggle a lot to figure\nout how to do some tasks like disabling some types of Notifications. Long time\nMotorola users like me will find it really difficult to learn for first few\ndays.  \n3) camera and audio quality are average, so don't expect magical pictures or\nsounds.  \nHowever, even with all the cons, it's worth buying this phone.  \n4) biggest minus is that capacitative buttons are not backlit and notification\nlight is of single color only.\n\n", "As usual Amazon.... have praised enough about their services..I think it is\nnot required to re-write it again :-)  \n  \nOne of the best affordable phones given the price range and product range.\nOnly problem is with MI, they restrict lot of the functions forcing you to\nbecome MI User (create a user account in MI maintained server) which I hate\n(probably most will do it willingly)..  \nAlready lot of best reviews have been provided by professionals about this\nmobile and hence I am only writing on the CONS.  \n\\- Camera / pictures taken during non sun light hours are noisy.  \n\\- Full volume call quality makes additional irritating noise which is not\npleasant.  \n\\- MI forcing users to become a member...\n\n", "very very bad , heating & battery problem , poor camera dont buy this phone\namzon is cheeting  \nnot hanging but heating problem , battery just one day camera poor\n\n", "1\\. Nice part is it's Battery  \n2\\. It's Price.  \n3\\. Display.  \n4\\. LTE (VoLTE)  \n5\\. Handy size.  \n  \nCons.  \n1\\. Heats quickly.  \n2\\. Drains battery.  \n3\\. Average Camera Quality ( But on the positive side it's PRICE so can be\nadjusted)  \n4\\. No headphone by CHINESE BRANDS. (Don't know what's the secret but, I guess\nCOST cutting)  \n  \nFinal Verdict: If you want a phone with all the features with lesser price and\na great battery life, you need to defiantly try this.  \n  \nAll the above-mentioned details are my views and thoughts. May change to\nperson to person.  \n  \nBut price keeping the price point it's a great phone.\n\n", "I got my Redmi, a day late than the delivery date but amazon gave me 100/-INR\nfor the delay, although didn't required it, but thank you so much for this\ngesture.

Feeling good\nand hope it works great as it's predecessor s.\n\n", "Here is my complete report review after using it for two days extensively  \n1\\. It is quite heavy phone for 5 inch screen phones. I had earlier Redmi 4A,\nwhich was quite lighter than this.  \n2\\. It does not have complete aluminium body. Back of the Phone is divided\ninto 3 parts out of which one part is aluminium only. Others seem to be\nplastic only.  \n3\\. It does not have backlight for navigation keys - Recent button, Home\nButton and Back Button. So you may find difficult to use it in night because\nyou have to go by idea only to tap these three buttons.  \n4\\. There is no tap to wake and sleep feature which is generally available in\nother phones of MI.  \n5\\. Battery Backup is normal. Nothing extra ordinary if compared to my\nprevious phone Redmi 4A.  \n6\\. Most importantly it has 4GB ram, but you will never get more than 2.1GB\nram free.  \n50% of ram is used by system only and you will get only 2gb ram only.  \n7\\. It is 64gb storage phone. But you will get only 54gb only. 10gb storage is\nused by system itself. If you update your phone as it shows updates when you\nconnect to Internet, you will loose 2gb more internal storage. So you will end\nup with only 52gb ram.  \n  \nI am still testing it's sensors and will update my review once again\n\n", "I am using the 3/32Gb variant of the Redmi 4. For about a Month Now. The phone\nso far is great  \nPros..  \n1.bettry backup is awesome goes for about 2 days without any hassel.  \n2.screen is bright and good  \n3.no lags and mi theme and wallpaper also preety and nice  \n4.camera is super quality at this price  \n5.speaker loud and clear mic and speaker both are found in iphone atyle  \n6.and other mi features auto call recording, seconds space, dual account and\nmany more is so cool.  \n7.and last metal body is also good  \n  \nCons..  \n  \n1.heating when wether is hit and while charging 70% to 90%  \n2\\. some minor bugs but its not problem every time and google smart assistant.\nVoice recognition stops functions.  \n3\\. Heating issue solved post latest update.\n\n", "Just got this Mobile 2 days before the scheduled delivery which was Wednesday.\nThat was a surprise. Most of the features of this Mobile is okay but NOT\nPROVIDING A EAR PHONE is not appreciated. Can you send one free of cost.\nSecondly the TYPE of USB should have been properly explained. So I put a\nquestion regarding this particularly enquiring whether this Mobile has C TYPE\nUSB PORT I got answers from some customers that it has C type. Since the\nSupplier and/or manufacturer did not give a clear picture, I depended on the\nviews of customers and ordered this item. This was another surprise that I\nfound that it has usual USB port. I feel that a clear picture should have been\nprovided by those responsible. Secondly some part of this Mobile is made of\nflimsy material for instance the SIM TRAY. Even after using the SIM CARD TRAY\nREMOVING PIN, the edge of this tray where there is a hole for inserting the\nPin broke. In normal case just for the USB PORT i WOULD HAVE RETURNED THIS\nPRODUCT. But whicheverway the hole provided in the SIM TRAY broke from my\nhands for not fault of mine, I don't think I should return the whole Mobile.\nIf AMAZON or the manufacturer/supplier thinks that they should take this\nmobile back and provide a replacement or atleast replace the SIM TRAY , I will\nbe very happy .  \nThanks.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 17 October 2017", "on 14 October 2017", "on 1 January 2018", "on 7 September 2017", "on 5 September 2017", "on 13 October 2017", "on 5 January 2018", "on 27 September 2017", "on 7 August 2017", "on 24 December 2017"], "reviewer": ["Anoop", "Satish Dubey", "Amazon Customer", "sarath gishi", "Ranadheer Reddy Keesari", "Nash Avi", "POPO", "JatinderPalSingh", "Rajnikant Dubey", "GOPALAKRISHNAN"]},

In todays global\nscenario the company should very clearly share this information with the\nbuyer.\n\n", "Hi buyers and my friends... \ud83d\ude42  \nHope you all are good...now lets come on the phone review. Every phone has pro\nand cons. This phone has too. After using redmi 4 for around 5 months, i found\nthese results:-  \nPRO:-  \n1\\. Price- Its price is just can't beatable by any phone company. As xiaomi is\nknown for its good smart phones with in budgeted price.  \n2.Camera- I will put camera factor in both category, in pro as well as in\ncons. Because camera quality is better than other phones of xiaomi like redmi\n3s, redmi note 3 and all other older varients but if we compare it with other\ncompany phones,then it will not satisfying.  \n3.processor- Qualcomm Snapdragon 435. Its very good processor if we consider\nit for mid range phones and provides good performance.you can play heavy games\nwithout seeing any lagging.  \n4.Battery- It contains a huge battery in it.,4100 mah. Just Wow.  \n5.Sensors- you will get all types of sensors including IR blaster(for remote\ncontrol) and fingerprint sensor.  \n6.Operating system- It comes with miui 8(marhsmallow 6.0.1 ) and its miui 9\nupdate with android 7 nougat is on its way. It will get in all the phones by\nthe end of november.  \n7.Metallic body- its build quality is very good and feels good in the hand.\nIts grip is awesome. It also has gorrila glass which gives your phone an extra\nprotection.  \n  \nThe list is long but space is less...  \n  \nCONS:-  \n1.Heating problem- you will face heating problem while heavy usage of device.\nIt will work fine if use it normally.  \n2.camera- camera quality is not so good as compared to other phones.  \n3.No stock android- I think its not the con, but many people wants to go with\nstock android. So i am putting it in this category.  \n4.Oreo update- no oreo update will come on this device.  \n  \nRecommendation:- you can consider this phone in budgeted range. I recommend to\nbuy 3gb of ram and 32gb of storage varient. Although 2gb of ram and 16 gb of\nstorage varient is also considerable over redmi 4a.  \n  \nThats all from my side...

Calling - There is a problem with MIC noise cancelation the person on the\nother side cannot hear us clearly most of the times and this is not because of\nnetwork issue.  \n3\\. Gaming - Phone heats up while playing mobile legend and several other\nonline games if you play it for more than an hour.  \n4\\. Gallery - It feels like you are in 2013. The gallery does not have the\noption wherein we can set whatsapp dp directly. You do not even have enough\noptions to edit photos in gallery unlike other smart phones which are\navailable at \u20b95000.  \n5\\.

Needless to say\nthat they have lived up to the expectation with Redmi 4 too. The gold variant\nlooks good, the touch feels good and the phone is running smoothly on moderate\nusage.  \n  \nHowever, the new launch from a competitor like coolpad, price drop of an\nexcellent handset like honor 6x, aggressive pricing by Lenovo makes me rethink\nwhether Redmi 4 is the best bet in the budget range now (Aug. 13, 2017).  \n  \nVerdict- if you prefer a recognised processor (Snapdragon) and a superior user\ninterface (MIUI) opt for Redmi 4. Else, try honor and/or coolpad for awesome\ncamera quality (dual rear camera).  \n  \nNote: this analysis comes after descent usage of all the devices mentioned\ndirectly/indirectly in this review.

Pricing:- At \u20b98500 you are getting 4 GB ram and 64 GB storage which is\nreally great. And even if you get this variant @ \u20b910000 it's still good to\nbuy.  \n2\\. Battery:- The 4100 mAh battery is savage it can give you 2 days of battery\nlife without any hassel.  \n3\\. Performance:- This phone performance is top notch the snapdragon processor\nand 4Gb of ram combo really shines and makes the overall experience lag free.  \n4\\. Camera:- The 13 megapixels camera captures some great shot in good\nlighting condition and 5 megapixels selfie shooter is adequate for facebook\nand insta posts.  \n5\\. Build Quality:- I must say this black variant really looks wicked in\nperson and really good to hold in the hands the overall fit and finish is\nfirst class and looks expensive than it really is.  \nCons:-  \n1\\. Display:- Although the quality of display is superb and bright for 8500.\nBut at it's original price i.e \u20b910999 this 720p panel is not something to\nwrite home about Xiaomi should provide 1080p panel for atleast 4Gb variant\nbecause at this price no other manufacturer is providing 720p display for\ntheir smartphones.  \n2\\. Non backlit capacitive keys:- It is real pain to use the phone without\nbacklit keys although you will get use to it after sometimes but the point is\nif you can provide notification LED light then why can't you provide a LED\nunder the capacitive touch panel.  \n3\\. No Protection for the Display:- Xiaomi has a history of not providing any\nprotection for their smartphones which is not good for the consumers as the\ndisplay is the most delicate part of the phone it gets broken really easily\nand 2.5D glass which is curved at the edges are susceptible to break real\neasy.  \n4\\. Charging Time:- Charging time is really long it takes more than 3 hours to\ncharge the device. The phone is fast charging enabled but Xiaomi hasn't\nprovided any fast charger out of the box.\n\n", "This is my second bad experience with Redmi phones. I bought this phone in\nJune last year(2017) getting convinced at the ratings (above 4). For the first\n6 months it ran flawlessly. The display was great and performance was amazing\nat the given price point. But to my utter disappointment, the phone battery\nstarted failing from January this year. The battery drains out completely\nwithin 2 hours after doing a full recharge. When I took my phone to the MI\nservice centre, they examined it and said that the battery has 'swollen' and\nneeds to be replaced. Phone battery warranty is for 6 months only and my phone\nhad just touched the 7th month. This is the first time I am hearing a phone\nbattery getting swollen. To make matters worse, this swelling has pushed the\nfront display panel and has caused it to bend slightly. The service centre\nstaff also advised to replace the front display panel as well. The total bill\n- almost 3700/- It will not even get exchanged. Now I have to again buy a new\nphone within 7 months of buying this one.\n\n", "Phone looks absolutely superb, easy to handle, perfect dimensions for my\nliking. I don't have heavy usage, for my use performance seems perfect so far,\nno lags. Finger print sensor also works reasonably fast. Display is good, but\nFHD wud have been perfect. Camera is average, for a pricing of 8.5k it looks\ndecent. Only let off I felt is the battery, even with 4000 mah, I got only 7.5\nhrs usage and 30 hours standby, which is terrible. It will take exactly 3\nhours and 15 minutes to get fully charged which also I felt a bit\ndisappointed. Phone gets heated while charging in between 35-85%, except for\nthat I didn't find much heating issues. Overall except for the battery\neverything looks good.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 3 August 2017", "on 28 November 2017", "on 9 August 2017", "on 29 May 2017", "on 10 September 2017", "on 13 August 2017", "on 10 October 2017", "on 28 September 2017", "on 24 January 2018", "on 16 October 2017"], "reviewer": ["CHAITANYA", "JaSs SinGH", "Krishna Murty Ryali", "Sunil B.", "Rafique Talukdar", "SK007", "Neelesh Bhandari", "akash", "Prantik Sarkar", "NJ"]},

It is an astoundingly\nwell-designed phone. Taking cues from the superlative Redmi Note 4, Xiaomi has\nfurther refined that design and shrunken it to the 5-inch form factor of the\nRedmi 4 and the results are glorious. It is 8.65mm thick, which is equitable\nconsidering the monstrous 4,100mAh battery. It is also perfectly balanced at\n150 grams which makes it neither too light, nor too heavy.  \n  \nThe important thing is that it feels great in the hand. The sides are nicely\nrounded from the back and it is thick enough that it snugly nestles in one's\npalm. It is also not a large phone which enables one hand usage with utter\nease.  \n  \nIt also helps that it looks great. Make no mistake, its design might be bland\nas it follows the age-old mantra that Apple devised for the iPhone and still\nretains in the iPhone 7, but this looks like a really nice phone which\nshouldn't be less than Rs 10,000, but it is. And in the black finish it looks\nmajestic and kind of like the iPhone 7 in matte black, but again that will\nonly win it brownie points.  \n  \nThe other aspect of the design that one needs to touch upon is that the\ndisplay has a 2.5D curved cover glass which makes swiping across the Android\nuser interface all the merrier. Also, that display even if it\u2019s just 5-inches\nand 720p, is brighter and more vivid than the one on the Redmi 3S which means\nit is better for viewing content. Overall, it is a good display and something,\nthat will please most users.\n\n", "Best in 9k.  \nSuperb battery back up  \nSlim. Design  \nSpeakers are good  \nGreat sound in ear piece  \nMany other awesome features  \n  \nThe only con is manufacturer has provided a short USB cable with the charger.\nAlso fast charging is not there.  \nBut in 9k it's full paisa vasool  \n  \nEdit Feb 2018  \nThe screen is very low quality. Corning gorilla or AGC not used. My phone\ndropped from a mere 1 feet height and the screen broke. Highly disappointed\nwith xiaomi.\n\n", "Review based on 1 week use:  \n  \n1) phone is good in terms of speed.  \n2) look wise is good.  \n3) 2.5 d making phone sometimes hard to handle although it's only 5 inch.  \n4) facing trouble with call quality in terms of hearing other side voice,\nwhich I never faced with any of my previous phone  \n5) within one week, charge pin loose contact and charging is headache due to\nthis.  \n6) phone heat up while charging at room temperature within 15 minutes.  \n  \nRating is for headache but it's a good bang for the buck...\n\n", "Value for money.. Amazon delivered it within 24 hrs (with a prime membership).\nBought during Mi anniversary so got the 5% cashback for SBI card payment..\nHere is my review after using for a month..  \n  \nPros:  \n\\- Made in India  \n\\- 5 inch phone  \n\\- Finger print sensor  \n\\- light weight  \n\\- 4100 mah battery lasts more than 2 days  \n\\- Nice look for this price  \n\\- infrared booster remote  \n\\- Expandable Memory  \n\\- and many more..  \n  \nCons:  \n\\- Screen casting (but its OK for this price)\n\n", "AWESOME MUST HAVE  \nUSING SINCE AUGUST 17 more than 5 months now.  \nTILL NOW NOT EVEN SINGLE ISSUE  \n  \nMI 64  \n(A) Hazzle free Performances  \nGaming with heavy games didn't lag once thanks to 4 gb ram  \nCan handle plenty of Apps at a time without any issues.  \n(B) Usage battery backup completely satisfied  \nBattery screen on Time 6:30 Heavy usage  \nNormally would give 9 to 10 hours a day screen on time  \nFor basic usage would last for more than a day or more.  \n(C) Miui is bonus Happy  \n(D) Getting Regular updates Got latest nougat, & miui 9.1  \n(E) Fingerprint scanner works extremely fine  \n(F) Just one drawback dose not have Gorilla glass protection  \nSo handle with extreme care otherwise screen would be broken.  \n  \nMUST HAVE RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE VERY HAPPY.\n\n", "I have been using the phone for past four days as my primary handset. Till now\nno heating issues I would rather say this gets cold in Ac due to a metal back\n.Camera quality is good for the price tag.front cam is exceptional.design vise\nthis phone is more premium than it looks in the pics,due to the 2.5d glass .\nThe metal back however needs some improvement in design. Speakers are good\nmaybe better but not the best.ram management is the point where you will feel\nyou are using a mid to high price range device.adreno cpu makes multitasking\nmore quick and easy. And at last the battery , this lasts almost 30 to 35\nhours in heavy light usage and around 20 hours of continue heavy usage.  \nThe fingerprint is so quick I hv never seen a quicker one. All in all a great\ndevice . Go for it!  \nRequest you to go for the 3 gb 32 gb version  \nNot the 2 gb 16 gb northern 4 gb 64 gb\n\n", "Amzon Service.  \nAmazon Service is pathetic. they wont return the product whatever the case. so\nbe careful.First time i have fade up with Amazon  \n  \nAbout the Phone  \nCons :-  \n1\\. Severely heating issue. if you talk for more than half and hour , it will\nbe fire place same as when you charging the phone.  \n2\\. Very brittle screen . if it falls from 3/4 ft screen will be broken and to\nreplace it will take 2/3 k backs.  \n3\\. Radiation(SAR) is very high.though them mentioned 0.75 but i feel it is\nmuch above that.  \n4\\. Not having power charging. so it takes lot of time to full recharge (\nProbably 4/5 hours).  \n5\\. Voice clarity is not good.  \nPros :-  \nLook wise it superb- it is like iPhone  \nlot of feature , though not are much useful.  \nprocessing is fast\n\n", "Well I must say, this product is very useful for cold regions, you won't feel\nthe necessity of a heater. The Redmi 4 is enough to heat your room up. It\nfeels like the hot radiator of a big Diseal locomotive engine. Worst phone I\nhave ever bought. The new phone is restarting again and againjust after\nunboxing. Even I haven't seen the home screen for a single time. Also, the\ninterface looks threatening to your personal data. Don't know what China is\nplanning. Mi is fooling people with fake flash sale. I am sure this product\nwill still remain on flash sale even if 1.3 cores Indians already have this on\ntheir hand. My message to those who are running after this handset just Handel\nyour curiosity and move to other options, otherwise you will be in a great\ndisappointment. I am returning it. Totally lost my control. Very disappointed.\n\n", "I have been using this phone for more than a month and i have to say its an\namazing device. The performance of this device cannot be compared to any other\n7k phone. I have seen some reviews where they complaint about camera but its\nrather satisfying by my opinion. The battery life is awesome i only charge\nthis phone once a day and i am more than satisfied i don't have to worry about\nbattery any more. The only down side is that it have heating issue but not\nthat much comparing to other devices i hope it got fixed with nogut update\nsoon.\n\n", "Impressed with Amazons fast delivery.  \nNow about phone,  \nIte awesome.  \nIt looks like sort of i phone, black color is so much beautifull.  \nBlack color glass and matt black aluminium body construction appears like\nunibody construction, which makes phone look premium.  \nBuild quality is superb, trust me, it is 2nd mi4 handset in my home, my mom\nhad dropped it meny times, but not single thing happened like cracking of\ndisplay, or popping up aluminium body, or big dent, nothing...  \nBuild quality is superp, gorilla glass serve its purpose, dosent get scratched\nwith regular usage.  \nCamera is good, power efficient processor is also good in power performance\nlike games.
