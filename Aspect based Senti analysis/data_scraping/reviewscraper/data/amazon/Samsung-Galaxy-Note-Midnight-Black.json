Following are my thoughts categorized\ninto Pros and Cons:  \n  \nPros:  \n* AWESOME Display: I am love with the crispness, sharpness, and vibrancy of color gamut displayed on the screen. The screen is Big and takes time to get used to, but within 1 week, I felt every other phone around me had a sub-par display (including 1plus5T). It's very hard to like anything else after this.  \n* Performance: I have played a couple of games and often forgot to close apps once I am done using them. Often they are minimized or running in the background. At one point, I had 15+ apps running subsequently and I didn't even notice any performance issues while using the phone. I accidentally noticed the # of apps running and I was pleasantly surprised with the device's performance. I have come to realize that \"A new redefined but familiar Samsung OS+Exynos Processor + 6GB of Ram\" is a deadly combination that's built to last. I can easily foresee that the phone will be relevant for next 3 years at least. This in a way justifies its high price against some lower end phones which start to show their true color within 1yr.  \n* Camera: I have taken stunning pictures of my daughter using Note 8 in broad daylight; and I say this even though I own a mid-range DSLR. The camera has performed brilliantly under natural light conditions. The camera has also performed quite wonderfully in the night as well, particularly under artificial light at home. The Dual Camera takes two images under live view setup and that's a nice to have feature. The Bokeh effect produced by software is very impressive and doesn't look gimmicky. However the camera has been a bit disappointing in extremely low light conditions and that's understandable as I was expecting a lot from a smartphone; then I do have a DSLR which would take over where Note 8 fails. On a side note, I have seen Google Pixel XL2 take great low light images - something that Note 8 can't give you. But as they say, there is nothing called \"a perfect phone\".  \n* Water Proof and Dust Proof: The phone is IP68 certified which means it is dust and waterproof. I play outdoor games and often the corners and edges where the back cover fits attract a lot of dust particles. To freak my wife, I often wash the phone with tap water to clean the dust and screen finger print marks. The look on her face is priceless. Lol ;) But having a phone which can resist elementary conditions around us is a definite plus for me.  \n  \nCons:  \n* Battery Backup: I wish I had more juice in battery which would make 100% charged phone last beyond a day. As I mentioned earlier, I am not hooked on the phone 24 x 7 but I do my share of gameplay, YouTube streaming, texting, browsing on the phone. I start my day with 99% charge and end my day with 13% left on my battery. I would say that's around average given other smartphones comfortably last more than 1 day (for example, Google Pixel XL 2).  \n* The speaker of the phone is a disappointment. I had better and louder sound output from Note 3. I don't know why Samsung didn't give front facing speakers like other phones have. It's puzzling.  \n* Finger Print Scanner: It's virtually nonexistent for me given its position right beside the camera lens. I have mostly used the Facial recognition to unlock the phone. Only in low light conditions or dark conditions, I have tried using Fingerprint sensor on the back to unlock the phone. The facial recognition works like a charm but it's definitely not as fast the one which One Plus 5T has (which is lightning fast).  \n* In order to protect the screen, there are no good screen guards/tempered-glass options available. I have wasted 2k in trying different screen guards only to find that the touch sensitivity of the phone is reduced after putting on the guard. I have found some screen good guards in USA, but those are extremely expensive (~$50). As of now, I am extremely careful while handling the phone especially when I am walking or talking.  \n  \nOverall I am happy with my purchase. I had to choose between Google Pixel XL 2\nand Note 8, and I wanted Note 8 for its bright display and comparable\nperformance. The camera isn't too far behind the Pixel 2. As I said, there is\nnothing called \"a perfect phone.\" All phones have various deltas which can be\nimproved. Somewhere I feel that's a strategy which Samsung, Apple, and Google\nadapt - to release the phone with some obvious flaws and deltas. I mean, \"Does\nit makes sense to put the fingerprint scanner next to cameras? Who was the\ndesign architect of this phone? I want to meet him\" :O :O  \nAnd of course, the next iteration has those deltas fixed and lures the\ncustomer towards them. For me, I\u200b am not looking at a smartphone for the next\n3 years at least.\n\n", "Very Nice product by Samsung.  \nMy last note phone was note 3  \nafter that i had purchased this mobile.  \nvery nice product\n\n", "Worth spending every penny .\n\n", "As one who shifted from iPhone, I am happy with my choice.

I have been using it for the past 9 days ..Its\nvery evident that they have rectified all their previous mistakes esp battery\nissue with note7 .. Note 8 is the best from the note series so far ..\n\n", "Another valuable addition to the Samsung family. Upgrading to the Note8 after\nusing the Note II for 4 years and it is a totally different experience\naltogether. Whether or not it is better than iPhone X is arguable, but it is\ndefinitely better than all other phones out there in the market. After having\nused the phone for more than a month now, here are a few pros and cons that I\nfind about this phone.  \nPros:  \n1\\. Huge 6.3 inch Super AMOLED QHD+ Display with a tall 18.5:9 aspect ratio\neasily beats any display in the market and will make you fall in love with it\nalmost instantly.  \n2\\. The S Pen is a Galaxy Note series exclusive stylus pen that has a lot of\nhandy features.  \n3\\. The latest Exynos Octa 8895 processor is a heavy duty performer and gives\nabsolutely no lag at all.  \n4\\. The 12 MP +12 MP Dual Pixel Dual Camera, along with the 8 MP Front Camera\nmake the photography experience one of the best in the market.  \n5\\. USB Type-C Fast Charging makes the phone charge really fast. And it is\nincluded in the box, unlike Apple's latest devices where you have to purchase\nit separately. Wireless charger though is sold separately, which is also a\ncool purchase.  \n  \nCons:  \n1\\. Though the display is mesmerizing, the 1440p display sucks out a lot of\npower and the battery doesn't last long. Note phones were known to be huge\nbattery carriers, but sadly 3300 mAh on this device just isn't enough.  \n2\\. The all glass body, though premium looking, is prone to breakeage. If you\nwant your phone to last long, a case and a tempered glass is a must.  \n  \nDespite a few cons, the pros for this device makes up for it. And the Note8 is\ndefinitely a great phone, which will certainly not disappoint.\n\n", "Beast of a phone.. A Phoenix reborn from the Ashes (of Note 7 last year) .. A\nnew boss in the Android arena..  \nAlmost all pros and negligible cons:  \n\\+ Premium built and feel.  \n\\+ Doesn't look that big in spite of having an above 6 inch screen.  \n\\+ Superb cameras, hands down one of the best, if not the best. Live focus\nmode is clearly superior to the similar options in other phones. Low light\nperformance is top-notch.  \n\\+ Samsung software looks better than ever.  \n\\+ Bixby requires some getting used to, but it builds over time and has some\nunique features up its sleeve due to its deep integration with the phone\nhardware and software.  \n\\+ S-Pen is one of the key factors that distinguish this phone from the crowd.\nThe pen has some nifty features that make your tasks very easy and convenient.\nLoved it.  \n\\+ In spite of having a somewhat lower battery capacity (compared to previous\nyear note and the S8+), the battery backup is good (if not the best). It's\nsufficient for a day's moderate use and then some in the night. Recommend\none'd charge it each night. It's not a hassle considering the fast charger\nprovided with the phone is a great one. Takes my phone around 1Hr40Mins to\nfully charge from 0 to 100.  \n\\+ Multitasking on this phone is a piece of cake thanks mainly to its advanced\nprocessor (exynos 8895 for India and Snapdragon 835 for US) and mammoth 6gb\nRAM.  \n  \n\\- The front and back is a fingerprint magnet. One has to clean it regularly\nif not using a cover.  \n\\- One handed use of the full screen is somewhat difficult (however, the one\nhanded mode in the settings and some other intelligent provisions provide\nalternative options for that).\n\n", "The Phone is awesome. The display is amazing snd so is the camera quality. My\nFirst Note series phone.\n\n", "Well after using Note 8 for 2 weeks plus find it absolutely fit in every\ncondition and phablet shows no lagging or heating during use. Its comfortable\nto use no size issue. Buy it if you are truly multitasking person who uses\nspen a lot.price is high but what to do its samsung.rest is good .\n\n", "An amazing piece of Engineering. The Note 8 is a complete package offering the\nfinest display, an amazing camera and utilities for both work and personal\nuse. The S-Pen is an added advantage, with the 4k cash back when you buy it\nwith a HDFC credit card every penny worth. I was an iPhone user till today and\nmy first Android!\n\n", "Coming from stock Android, I would say I am really impressed with this\ndevice...Samsung bloatware has been diluted down to the minimum I have ever\nseen on a Samsung device... !! The S-Pen works great. It is altogether a\ndifferent feeling when you are working with the Note 8. Small nifty little\ntweaks here and there adds to the cherry on the cake... :) The camera is one\nof the best smartphones cameras available as of writing this.  \n  \nI did however notice some lags over my period of usage (been 5 days). But that\ncan be fixed via an OTA update.  \n  \nThe only problem however, is the BATTERY life. During my normal usage it lasts\nfor about 6-7 hrs...Where in I make phone calls...Surf the\ninternet....Whatsapp mesages...Some social networking....etc...I need to\ncharge it once a while...  \n  \nBut I think Samsung played it safe here...After what happened with the Note 7\n!!  \n  \nOverall for people who can afford this device, do it without the blink of a\nthought !!\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 25 January 2018", "on 18 February 2018", "on 27 October 2017", "on 8 October 2017", "on 19 December 2017", "on 27 September 2017", "on 6 December 2017", "on 13 October 2017", "on 27 September 2017", "on 29 September 2017"], "reviewer": ["Amazon Customer", "Sanjay Parmar", "Sangam", "Appu john mathew", "Nikhil", "ChinmayJSK", "Vivek", "Nav", "Amazon Customer", "Saurabh Mittal"]},

Shud have just shipped it together\nbut I am sure its so annoying that they know many would forget or not be able\nto do the entire process due to time constraints and hence will not even take\nit!  \n  \nPhone is excellent and the free case inside the box is also excellent so try\nbefore u buy another case.\n\n", "The titan among all smart phones is back.

It is Dual SIM slot so you can play it with either two\nSIM cards or one SIM and an SD card. Camera and some other features are also\nthe best in its category.

I am a fan of Samsung Note Series.

This phone is a feature pack of several other\nthings, it's a powerful multimedia phone.  \nSleek in design and Camera is just awesome, I would say if you are planning to\nbuy a camera under 35K then better purchase Note 8 but you need to possess bit\nof photographic skill to use Pro mode, I have used the pro mode and trust me\nwhat a brilliance Note 8 just clicks.\n\n", "All Samsung Note users are surely going to love it.
