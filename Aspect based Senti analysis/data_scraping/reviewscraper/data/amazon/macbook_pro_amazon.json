I came across the new Macbook\nair and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first\nimpressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of\nsimilar price range and Macbook PRO  \n  \nAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:  \n# Slim and light weight for daily travel  \n# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage  \n# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium\nlaptop  \n# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13  \n# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype\ncalls  \n# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor  \n# Metal body construction  \n# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.  \n# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are\nnot aware of this feature)  \n# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3\ndays, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %  \n# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos\napp, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OS  \n  \nAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:  \n# Performance is on lower side  \n# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail  \n# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In\nIndia they come at premium)  \n  \nShould you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantages  \nI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some\nadditional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience  \n  \n# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to\nbuttons on Air, Adjustable pressure  \n# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while\nPRO is 2560x1600 pixels  \n# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in\nreal world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The\ndifference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming,\nVideo encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this\ncan go with Air and save some money.  \n# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air\nuses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a\nlittle upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with\n7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy\nconsumption.  \n# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor  \n# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the \"Macbook\". Keys are\nless deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air\ncomes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO  \n# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus  \n# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color\noptions  \n  \nIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and\nAir, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO\noffers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.  \n  \nWhom Air is for?  \nMacbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who\nlove to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic\nprogramming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But\nSoftware like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But\nif you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.  \n  \nI will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on\ntesting and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try\nto answer in a day or two.  \n  \n[...]! Thanks\n\n", "3+ Months of Usage:  \nVery good for development purpose. Handles Android studio without any issues.\nBest budget laptop for programmers.\n\n", "very good product and I am quite happy with my new mac. I am basically\nprogramming person. I have installed the OpenCV and Python along with MATLAB\ntool for image and video processing and it runs well on this machine.
