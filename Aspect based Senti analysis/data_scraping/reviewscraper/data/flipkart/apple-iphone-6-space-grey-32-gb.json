{"rating": 2, "title": "Pathetic Delivery experience", "review": "Well to begin with the product is good and authentic however the one thing that made me regret buying from Flipkart was the delivery time and ekart logistics. First of all horrible customer service by Flipkart and ekart logisics. I mean first of all the product was not delivered on the promised date and on top of it no resolution provided by Flipkart customer service all they tell you is to wait. I mean how does it help if I have to wait!! waiting is the issue...thats why we call.\nNow moving on to the logistics Ekart is the worst and horrible logistic provider. I am into regular online shopping and never faced any issue with the logistics partner however when I called this particular delivery agent to provide me with the product before 5 he straight away denied and said I will deliver it to your neighbour or will come tomorrow. Now as it is the product is late and you are then telling me to deliver it to my neighbour...who takes the responsbility!! pathetic pathetic delivery experience never ever going to order from flipkart!!", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "6 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},
