{"rating": 4, "title": "Value for money", "review": "Honor 6x is a decent phone. Both front and rear camera quality is good. Audio quality is average. Though cellular call quality is good. Configuration and performance are up to the mark.\n\nBut what if a technically sound phone irritates you whenever you use it?\n\nThe phone's internal look and feel is good. What I hate about this phone is its font, font colour, and background.  Imagine a very thin font with light grey colour and a white background. It hurt your eyes easily after using it for a while. No theme can change that irritating font style, colour, and white background. This kills your eyes slowly.\nHuawei should think about that. They should allow users to change the font-colour, font-style, font-size and background colour according to their preference.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "8 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Malay Pradhan"},

{"rating": 4, "title": "Value-for-money", "review": "Hi all, \n\nI'm writing a review after a week use. I have used samsung, moto, htc before and this is the first time, trying out huweai honor mobiles. First thought to try honor 9i but I haven't seen much difference apart from camera. I have chosen this over others, for camera, better optimization, of course honor build quality and software management.\n\nNow coming to the mobile. I loved the look and design which is similar to its competitor Redmi note 4 but honor is little slim. This is definitely rich to hold, easy to handle but ofcourse slippery which is not a con ;) Display and color reproduction is good compare to other mobiles in this price range.\n\nwhen it comes to battery, not much impressed and definitely better than its another competitor 'moto g5'. I have used heavily, like high end graphic games, social media , camera shoot continuously and feel like it stays for a half day. But normal use with 4g turn on, it stays for one day. In this point, definitely should add ultra power and power saving mode option which is really awesome, to use your mobile with limited features for long time. No quick charge and takes 2 15 minutes to charge approx.\n\nWhen it comes to camera, honor gave lot of options to explore compare to other mobiles. Back camera is good. Selfie and bokeh effects are ok. Low light shots are not good. Slow motion video quality sucks.\n\nThis mobile running in an android nougat and EMI UI 5.0. ok ok feel. Rarely hangs. And performance is good. Mobile gets heated while playing high end games and charging. Apart from that, it is good unlike where moto and lenovo mobiles heats everytime while surfing.\n\nThe main con which would like to mention is less speaker audio quality and missing of IR blaster. Songs over headphone is also average. Call sound quality is also average. That's the only problem which I felt and apart from that , everything is okay and good. Hats off to the flipkart fast delivery. \n\nPS: always go ahead with 64gb, 4gb ram variant which performs better.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "25 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},
