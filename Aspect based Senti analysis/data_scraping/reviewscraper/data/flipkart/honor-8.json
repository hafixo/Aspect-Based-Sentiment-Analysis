{"rating": 5, "title": "Highly recommended", "review": "Short and simple review:\n\nPros\n1. Eye catcher. Amazing looks\n2. Perfect size. Not too large not too small.\n3. Great screen. Amazing color output.\n4. Outstanding camera.\n5. EMUI is wonderful. It takes time to get used to but its really precise, functional & efficient.\n6. Kirin processor is great. There is slight heat but its only normal.\n7. Speedy fingerprint sensor and useful for other functions.\n8. IR Blaster is really nifty with the built in app having profiles for most devices in the world. It could even control my local cable stb!\n\nCons\n1. This phone is a fingerprint magnet.\n2. All glass body makes it really slippery. Better use it with a cover.\n3. Single sim. This depends on preference though.\n4. No usb 3 or quick charge. At this price point, such features are expected.\n5. The battery saver app is quite strong. Makes some apps behave weird. It cud be turned off fr settings though, for each app separately.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "24 Oct, 2016", "reviewer": "Nyukeit Thakkar"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Perfect product!", "review": "It's been about 10 days since the purchase and being my first Honor phone I must say I'm very impressed with this phone. I'm not much of a gamer so this review is not based on the gaming performance although I only played temple run and it was a flawless experience! \n\nLikes\n1. Smooth performance without any lags or abrupt closing of apps. \n2. Primary camera performance is awesome in pro mode.\n3. Screen looks awesome and is good to view in daylight as well if the brightness is set to nearly 50%.\n4. Flexibility of expandable storage or dual SIM.\n5. Although more than 80  apps are installed on the phone there is still 2gb memory free at all times.\n6. Front facing camera is very impressive in artificial lighting conditions as well.\n7. Customization options in EMUI are excellent but may be an overkill for people coming from pure android phones.\n8. Battery life is awesome and lasts 24hrs with normal usage and atleast 18 hours with heavy usage.\n\nDislikes:\n1. The default mode in which the camera opens is not pro mode and I personally don't like this as the depth of field has to be adjusted in the default mode almost every time to take group pics.\n2. EMUI takes a little getting used to esp for first-timers like me. The notifications setting is a bit of a pain to get used to.\n3. Noticed heating around the camera area when using the camera, esp when taking 10-12 pics.\n4. Full charging takes nearly 2 hours although it takes around 30 mins to get to 40% when needed.\n\n\nOverall a great phone at this price range though it has its flaws like every other phone. If the budget is limited this one and the op3  would be great choices to consider.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "7 Nov, 2016", "reviewer": "Saleem Khan"},
