{"rating": 4, "title": "Digit.in Expert Review: Live life king sized with the Lenovo Phab 2", "review": "Sometimes, size does matter. Lenovo\u2019s new goliath. the Phab 2, is a smartphone with a screen that can put most of its category counterparts to shame. Besides the large screen, you also get a metal build and a host of other awesome features.\n \nTaking a closer look at the device, the first thing that you will notice is the large display. The Lenovo Phab 2 sports a colossal 6.4-inch HD display. The large size is great for those who love watching a lot of videos, or playing graphic-heavy games.\n \nJust above the display is the earpiece, front camera and sensors. The phone sports a 5MP front-facing camera. So for all you selfie lovers, the Lenovo Phab 2 can deliver.\n \nAt the bottom of the phone you\u2019ll find the speakers and a standard micro USB port. The Lenovo Phab 2 comes with Dolby Atmos audio enhancements. This combined with the large display, make the phone perfect for watching videos.\n \nAt the back of the phone is the 13MP primary camera. Like the phone\u2019s elder brother, the Phab 2 Plus, you get an AR mode. With this turned on, you will be able to add a cat, puppy, fairy, or even a dragon to any picture. That\u2019s not all, you can also interact with the virtual creatures and play with them.\n\n \nWhat\u2019s the point of having a large display if you can\u2019t spend hours watching videos on it. The Lenovo Phab 2 comes with a 4050mAh battery, which should be enough to last you all through the day.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true, "EXPERT_REVIEW": true}, "date": "24 Apr, 2017", "reviewer": "Digit.in"},

{"rating": 4, "title": "The best phablet at this price", "review": "Editing this after  a superbb stress usage  after 1.5 months or so..\n\nwith so many thing s in mind went for the OTA update and trust me the phone seems superbbb 4g aiirtel is running like a mad speed and its  awesomely col while charged up and low battery issues solved.\n\nGo for it at this price you will not need any other phone\n\nI am an avid MI user and practically I feel no phone can match to the hardware and software tuning that an MI device gives. bee using a MI note, note 3, note 4 and also possess an MI Max9the big daddy).\n\nthis is an honest review after 3 weeks of intense usage.\n I will go straight to the specs.\nDont think anything about the processing power, its mindblowing .A massive 3 GB RAM, MediaTek (MTK 8735) quad-core processor, the Lenovo Phab 2 takes your smartphone experience to the next level for sure.\nAlthough my redmi note 3 still uses 3gb ram what I have found is the ram left after using the same number of apps on both, the phab 2 still has approx 1.72gb of ram free whereas the Redmi note 3 has only 1.2 to 1.5gb free which is a remarkable spec considering the display size is massively huge in Lenovo Phab 2.\nTheres no lag in the apps and the the smartphone works butter smooth.theres no heating issue at all even with the phone being on charge for a long time. The redmi note 3 has ample amount of heating issue. The ram the storage is more than enough and u can slide a massive 128gb micro sd card to expand beyond the normal level.\nNow comes the most important part the display.\n\nGuys remember this is a sub 10k range phone so dont expect this to have a brilliant display like samsung or infinity display type stuff. Saying that I just loved this display at 65-70% brightness and a great Airtel 4g connection, HD videos on youtube are a treat to watch. the display is crisp, colors ae good and the screen melts into the bezel so effeortlessly that you wont need a tv or a larger monitor once u a re habituated with this device. Chats and scrolling fb , twitter are so easy with the big display. Also needs to be mentioned is the touch responsiveness which is simply awesome, the touch reponse is so good u can actually somehow use the device with one hand although its big for one hand usage.\nI guess the back side is removable which is a great thing  considering the massive battery and the heat dissipitation once can expect from a device.\nOnly one small issue I felt was the lack of enough battery for a heavy usage user like me for the entire day but who cares till you have a MI or ROMOSS power bank with you. the battery lasts for one complete day with oderate to heavy usage and remember by usage i am meaning Airtel 4g usage. streaming, whatsapp, fb continously with almost 2hrs of talktime daily and 2 hrs of music almost thats a great battery but if it would have been 5000mah it was awesome. 4050mah is descent and does justice.\ntheres no fingerprint scanner but doenst matter much as this is a budget phablet.\nThe smartphone is 4g enabled and it always receive 4g for sure. the secondary sim is a 2g one.\n\ntheres no call block facility in lenovo so I have installed the Zen Asus UI dialer for the same, now its a complete mean machine.\n\nLaslty the Dolby ATMOS my goodness the sound effect surpasses the reproduction quality of my 5000rs pioneer car stereo impact. Audio quality is a tricky stuff as i am weariing a spec so cannot put the phone so big on the ears but with earphones the audio s awesome voice call clarity is simply superb.\n\nratings:\nBattery :7.5/10\nDisplay : 8/10\nprocessor and Ram: 8/10\nBudget: 9.5/10\nquality of the hardware/ device build: 8/10\nperformance : 8/10\n\nOverall at this price point with such a huge display and look and feel, the gunmetal grey Lenovo Phab 2 is a great must buy product.\n\nLenovo Phab 2 overall rating 8/10.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "27 Apr, 2017", "reviewer": "Arunabha Saha"},
