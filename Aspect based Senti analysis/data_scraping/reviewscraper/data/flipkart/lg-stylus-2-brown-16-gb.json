{"rating": 5, "title": "Perfect product!", "review": "Great product. After using it almost a month it comes much easier to me. Stylish outlook with a 16 GB ROM perfect. But the Ram must be 3 GB at least.Camera performance is also good.Overall it's a great presentation by the no.1 (make by Indian people) company LG in the price slot of 16000/-.\n\nSo if you are looking for mid range great pick this is the best choice for you instead of using those cheap Chinese products. \n\nAnd please remember LG has the Customer Choice Vote for last few years in India. Thanks LG for making a phone like this. And Flipkart & Ekart Logistics  too as they delivered it in just 2 days.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "15 Feb, 2017", "reviewer": "Biman B. Das"},
{"rating": 5, "title": "The best a real mobile lover can get", "review": "I am writing this review after extensive use of around 3weeks. Don't think it's little duration coz I choose this master piece after almost 6months of Research.\n\nOk let's talk about the phone, if you really want to get more out of your phone then this is the one. It's a best choice against cheap China mobiles which gives you mammoth configuration but not the piece of mind and a reputation you suppose to get by owning a classic phone.\n\nThis phone will really gives you all that you want plus the look which will make you feel proud in your circles. Let's give me a glimpse of the things I love about this decent phone.\n\nIt's a high quality premium phone which works silky smooth and gives you not all but most of the features of expensive phones in current market.\nIt's sensors are so powerful that makes use of the phone CPU and battery in most efficient way. Battery will easily last for 24hours if you are even a heavy user, it never get hung and still keep itself mr.cool.\nNo heating no lags.\n\nCamera is Good in day light, but I would always say that Don't expect more from any mobile camera. They are just to capture Instant memories and not the life time memories.\nStylus is awesome....\nSmart lock works excellent, phone won't gets lock until you put it aside.\n Screen is HD but will never make you disappointed.\nMultiple keyboards including handwriting.\nOk Google works best\nMost important call quality is best and signal strength is also awesome.\nUSB and Bluetooth tethering\nDLNA works super fast...my Panasonic viera 630 connects instantly with this phone Sound is great, loudspeaker and in the box headphones are truly best.\nIn the box flip cover is added advantage,you can receive calls without opening the flip, can see music play back, check for any unattended messages, reply the messages by voice etc.\nYou can design your own icons,LG smart world will give you more options as well for theams\n\nEven though this phone is having average specification, but still it will give give you most of the advance features which other phone won't be able to give you.\n\nYou can reality test it's quality, by an example off light sensor.. Brightness will become100 in sunlight and moves to 0 in a dark room. This is just an example how you can judge a difference between quality phone and fully loaded cheap phone.\n\nHope this help you decide  getting your dream phone. I got my one, now it's your turn.....!\n\nWell done and thanks a lot LG.\nAnd Hats off to flipkart for swift delivery.\n\nThanks \nHiren", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "23 Jul, 2016", "reviewer": "Hiren Sutaria"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Super, Excellent,Mind blowing", "review": "This phone is too good that i cann't discribe its worthfullness in words.\nIts rear as well as front camera picture quality beats the apple i phone 6s plus camera quality but not 7s plus.\nIts ram manage ment is so powerfull that I installed more than 380 apps and still there is no heating & laging issue.\nDo other  4 Gb smartphones handle this task? I don't think so  that they can handle it so eficently .\nThis smartphone  is an eye opener to other smartphones  for there so called Full HD Display.Although it is only HD Display but friends believe me its display & colour reproduction is out of the world.Viewing on this device is a real visual delight.Do You know LG is the company which manufactures the  display & other important hardware of i phone.\nIts every thing whether it is call quality,stylus,sound quality  is  a demostration of unparalled quality in this price segment.\nFriends i suggest that don't buy cheap feature loaded chinese smartphones.\nI select this phone after one year rigirous & intensive research work so that their shouldn't remain any loophole  in my decision making.Now after 3 months of rigirous use i feel proud to my decision that my phone gave me worth of every peny i had spent on it.\nThanks to LG.", "verification": {}, "date": "20 Nov, 2016", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},

{"rating": 4, "title": "Terrific", "review": "Hi, I m writing this review after 25 days of usage.The phone specification are readily available here is my review on overall performance.\n\n Performance wise I would say this is nice phone for day today use.\n\n2gb ram is more than enough to handle 5-6 applications at a time as far as multitasking is concerned.\n\n16gb internal storage is on lower side ,however you get dedicated sd card slot that should suffice the things.\n\nIt has sd410 soc which is old one still handles things pretty well.The CPU is underclocked at 1.2ghz due to which heating is quite under control.maximum temperature I noticed at any given point even with heavy application is 40\u2103.\n\nGaming performance is avg. Considering it's hardware which is not that powerful other than few frame drops or minor lags most of the heavy games are playable.\n\nIn camera department I found it to be very good   in daylight condition and above avg in artificial lightning condition. Same is the case with front camera..the back camera though takes sometime to focus in some cases. Camera application is basic but has some good features like click on smile detection.\n\nBattery life is above avg it will last you for full working day with 4g n wifi-on  on mix to heavy usage. Average screen on time you can get is upto 5-6 hrs.It takes more than 2 and half hours for full charging.\n\nThere are only basic sensors like ambient light ,proximity and accelerometer. no compas no gyro.\n\nCall quality and loud speaker quality is excellent (one of the reason to buy this phone inspite of weak hardware)\n\nSoftware is lag free I don't find any issue with it till date.\n\nIt's proper dual sim device with both sim supporting 4g volte.It has stylus which a good additional feature.It's full polycarbonate body and very light weight handset.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "3 Jan, 2017", "reviewer": "S R"},
