{"rating": 5, "title": "Awesome", "review": "Best@ this price range.\n\nRedmi 4a(3gb ram) feel nice even it is built by plastic body and the display looks  vibrant enough to read on day light..noticable thing ,it is very light in weight. Battery can manage to hold a full day in a single charge.\nI think, no.other phone, using SD425@ this price range, I can't say it is a power house, but u can play almost medium graphics games. But strictly saying if u r a game maniac, this is not the phone for u. Littlr bit of hewting issue is there, when u play games and using internet for a few hours. I speed test with moto c+ ,4A could easily beat it. \nCamera can give u good results compare to other mobiles. I can say this is one of the best camera at this price range. Color reproduction, low light photo and  obviously daylight pictures are better than moto c+. But in day light over exposure is there, so some portions of a pucture looks whashed away. If u r looking for best camera in this price range, redmi4(2gb RAM) is the best one. Let me say one thing.. When I speed test redmi4a(3gb ram) with redmi4(2gb ram) almost all conditions excluding with games, redmi 4a(3gb ram) wins!!! Believe me!!\n\nHere some tips for u\n1) its a quard core SoC mobile so don't install more than 10 apps. Also uninstall preinstalled apps like flipkart.\n2) Reset ur camera settings as: picture quality to &quot;high&quot; and contrast to &quot;lower&quot; to get more detailed pictures\n3) Don't use mobile while charging, it can damage ur battery ( better switch off while  charging)\n4) its plastic so use buttons softly..\nThanks for ur patient reading and don't forget to like my review", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "1 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "ANIL KUMAR M.H."},
