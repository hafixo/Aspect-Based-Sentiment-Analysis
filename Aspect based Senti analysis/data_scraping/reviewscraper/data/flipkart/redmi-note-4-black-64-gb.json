{"rating": 5, "title": "Excellent", "review": "I bought the Matte Black 4GB/64GB varient of Xaomi Redmi Note 4. So here's the review:\nPROs:\n1. Nice slim design with 2.5D glass.\n2. Outstanding performance. (SD 625 is very efficient & almost 2GB RAM remains free at any instant to accompany the CPU)\n3. Camera is decent at out doors & front camera is also great. ( Root your note 4 to unlock 4k recoding and manual shutter speed so as to shoot like a pro)\n4. Screen is just amazing. Colours pop.\n5. Overall MIUI experience is very decent and friendly.\n6. Tons of customizable features for enthusiasts. (Thanks to MIUI)\n7. Fingerprint sensor does it's job like a boss.\n8. No heating issue till writing this review.\n9. Awesome battery backup. ( Thanks to 14nm process)\n10. Almost all required sensors in a smartphone are available.\nCONs:\n1. Speaker is not upto the mark. It's loud but not clear enough.\n2. Camera should be better in some cases.\n3. Fast charging not available.\n4. MIUI prioritize looks over performance just opposite to the Oxygen OS. I hope updates shall bring balance.\n5. Lacks availability due to annoying flash sales.\nReason for 5 stars inspite of having many cons: It's price, built quality and lack of close competitors at this proce point.\nJust go for it. You'll love it.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "26 Jun, 2017", "reviewer": "Bibhash  Bora"},

No sign of lag.\n2.Touch is smooth and super responsive.\n3.Phone features are awesome. Some apps and features are really very helpful for day to day life. \n4.Dual apps support is there. You can have two facebook,two whatsapp, two imo at a same time.\n5.4g network and volte enabled.\n6.sound is ok ok, not so good. It could have better. My lenovo k3 note has better sound than mi 4 note.\n7.camera is the most talked about feature of this phone after its realese. I have tested it today. Checked with the normal light, outdoor condition, low light. Outdoor photo is superb. Indoor and low light photos are bit lower quality.\nThough I think it's better than the mi note 3.\nWill experiment with  the camera in the near future.\n8. Out of 64 gb, 54 gb is free. Out of 4gb ram ,2 gb remains free.\n9.#battery is the most important part of this mobile. 4100 mah battery will give you enough juice to run the phone for two days if you are soft moderate user. For regular  users it will give one day battery back up very easily. Hardcore user will get 7 hours screen time.\n10.Snapdragon chipset , octacore 2ghz  will give you smiling face while playing with the smartphone.\nNote: at this price range(12999/- ) it's highly recommended. 64 gb internal memory, 4gb ram will make you happy for sure.
