{"rating": 4, "title": "Pretty good", "review": "My honest opinion about this device after 7 days of use \n\n\nPROS:-\n \n1) price - main pros is its price \n2) built - built quality is really nice \n3) display - it has 720p hd display which is very good at this price \n4) battery - battery is good easily. If u r very heavy user it will easily last for 1 day . Normal and medium user it will last to 1.5 to 2 days \n5) speaker - speaker is nice because of placement of speaker with dolby atmos which will givd u crisp sound\n6) charging - charging time is also good it charges 5000mah battery in almost 3 hrs which is good in my opinon\n7) processor - although it do not has poweful processor but found no lag ( i m not a gamer but a moderate user )\n8) memory - 3gb ram and 32 gb rom is very good deal in this price \n9) ram management - it has very good ram management at this price point \n10) fingerprint - finger print sensor is also good in my opinion \n\nCONS:- \n\ncamera - the only con is camera is not that good as expected but u can take some desent (average) pics but do not expect too much with camera\n\nSome other thing like i have faith in moto brand because earlier i used moto g3 which i loved a lot and moto has good reputation in the market and also flipkart service is also very good in my opinon.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Nice product", "review": "Well just with one day of usage I would like to comment -  it's a basic budget phone with few features added to gain attention and remain relevant in market. \n\nDisplay is bright, HD and does the job. \n\nCamera was disappointing in few indoors pics I tried,  maybe it's okay in outdoor. \n\nHandset speakers are good. \n\nMain compromise moto did is with  processor. Slight lag was evident from day one.  However,  it should be okay for basic usage like WhatsApp, Facebook, insta etc.  I personally felt moto should have put snapdragon even if prices increased by 1k.  It would have been a complete device then. \n\nThe hype about os,  I found bloatware present i.e unjustified memory blockage.  \n\nSo my verdict -  moto has huge fan Base and brand value,  those who want the  best of moto,  they can go for it,  it looks elegant,  slightly heavy owing to battery and overall good device for regular use.  I purchased it for my dad for mails and social media. \n\nBut those who are after performance and tech fanatics,  I would say this was moto's try to compete with Redmi Note 4 but choice of processor and excess loyalty to Google spoiled the fun.  \nSo, who should purchase? \n- first time 4G upgraders with limited usage,  govt/corporate people who need better back up,  moto fans and all those who need a decent  device under 10k.\n\nMobile photography enthusiasts,  Gamers,  tec savy guys, you won't be happy for sure! \n\nHowever, the biggest spoiler is,  Made In China  :P\n\nHope it helps :)", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "15 Jul, 2017", "reviewer": "Akashraj  Ghosh"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Packing the features in a limited budget.", "review": "I have written this comprehensive review keeping in mind that I have bought a phone which is within the Rs. 10K limit. So, there will be no grousing on Corning Gorilla Glass, NFC or Qualcomm Snapdragon processor in this review.\nThere are a bunch of unexpected Pros and Cons in the device. I will elaborate each striking feature so that it will help my fellow buyers in deciding if the product will suit them or not. \n\nPros: \n\n1. 2.5D Glass: This is exemplary for a phone in this budget. Together with its metal body design and embedded camera (similar to 5th Gen G-series), this phone gives an undoubted premium look. \n\n2. Dolby Atmos: The Moto E4 Plus is an audible delight. It outperforms Moto G5 and Moto X1 with its speakers as well as audio jack delivering one of the best sounds you can expect from a smartphone. \n\n3. Android 7.1.1 with 3GB RAM: There a quite a few Android Nougat phones in the market and owning the latest Android is something to brag. But it is essential to have sufficient RAM to utilize your smartphones to the fullest. My average RAM usage for 24 hours is 1.7 GB. Having a 2 GB RAM would be dreadful for both the product as well as the user. \n\n4. 32 GB ROM: The internal memory is sure to fulfil every user\u2019s needs. With enough and more space for apps and multimedia, Moto has given a really good deal within 10K. It is commendable that Moto maintained a dedicated slot for expansion rather than a hybrid slot. \n\n5. 5000 mAH Battery: This striking feature at the product launch is efficacious. With rough usage, the battery ended the day at 33% which is indeed remarkable! Under fair usage, the battery may last 2-3 days. \n\nCons: \n\n1. Camera: Although the camera specifications look promising, it doesn\u2019t perform as expected. The quality is average but not bad. If someone is looking for a great camera smartphone, this is not the one. \n\n2. Non-removable battery: For most users, the whole purpose of a removable battery is to shut down the mobile if it gets hanged. In case of a non-removable battery, you will have to wait till the charge drains completely. Considering a 5000 mAH battery, it would inconveniently take days till you run out of charge. Hopefully, Moto has designed a counter feature to prevent this occurrence. \n\n3. Moto gestures: Moto did a pretty good job by providing gesture operations for camera, flashlight, etc in higher models. Moto E4 plus is an incomplete smartphone without these features.\n\nNotable mentions: \n\n1. LED notification light: Many customers these days search for this feature. A cute little fancy dual colour notification light exists in this device to content the users. \n\n2. Performance: The MediaTek Quad Core isn\u2019t really that big a disappointment! It runs Asphalt 8 and NFS No Limits without any lag though a certain lag is experienced while launching such games. \n\n3. Turbocharger: One must not be too keen on this feature as Moto E4 Plus is not equipped with USB type-C. The 10W charger just ensures that the mammoth battery charges quicker than conventional 4-6W chargers.\n\nI know this might be one of the longest reviews on Flipkart, but if you liked it please give a thumbs up.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "17 Jul, 2017", "reviewer": "Niall Miranda"},

Stock android with no problems at all.\n3) Fingerprint (9/10). Works like charm.\n4) Sound (9/10 speakers, 8/10 headset). With dolby atmos, speaker sound is fanatstic but lacks with headset.

New feature in Moto handsets, quite useful for people who get larger volume of notifications.\n7) Weight, Bulkness (7/10). A bit bulky and heavy in comparison to latest mobiles in market, but that may attribute due to high capacity battery it contains. Not a problem for people who doesn't mind a little bulky phones.\n8) RAM (8/10). Handles multitasking easily, noticed a few loading issues here n there but that is mainly due to the processor it contains.\n9) Call Quality (9/10). No problems as such as of now.\n10) Processor (6/10). The biggest drawback for this mobile is the Mediatek processor it has, though most of the mobiles in this segment comes with snapdragon but Moto chose to go with Mediatek. There is no comparison between both of these. Snapdragon is way way ahead of Mediatek. But again, to accomodate the prices under 10k segment and giving a feature rich mobile, motorola compromised with the processor. The mobile operations are a little bit on a heavier side, but works well.\n11) Screen Display (8/10). HD display (1280 x 720 Pixels) not full hd. Viewing angles are good, display scores above average. \n12) Camera (7/10). Nothing to boast of. Both rear and front camera are for namesake.

Dolby Atmos sound too good for any video and audio\n5. 5.5 screen size and awesome display with good touch screen.\n6. 7.1.1 latest Android stock version excellent\n7. Processor works nicely\n8. fingerprint works perfectly\n9. Front camera with flash too good.\n10. One key navigation feature\n11. Dual sim with dedicated memory slot\n\nCons:\n1. Battery makes phone heavy Weight and looks bulky, 199 gram is too much weight for any phone.\n2.Mediatek processor could have been snapdragon, same as USA version, if total installed apps goes beyond 70+ affects phone performance.\n3. Back camera not upto the mark, photo quality is questionable and photos are hazy.\n4. Back cover very difficult to open up and to remove SIM-1 is like hell.\n4. If something goes wrong in warranty period , quality of Motorola centre's and arrogancey of service centre's guy's.\n\nWill give 8.5 out of 10 for overall performance, and value for Money.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "9 Aug, 2017", "reviewer": "Bhushan T"},
