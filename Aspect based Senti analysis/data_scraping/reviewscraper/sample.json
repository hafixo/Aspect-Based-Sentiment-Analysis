After a lot of research and thinking, I took a risk and bought this\none and now I didn't have to regret over my decision as this phone is a\ncomplete all rounder and far better than note 4 in many terms.  \nSome people were crying over the low performance CPU and GPU this phone is\nhaving but trust me guys, I personally tested almost all the high end games\nlike modern Combat 5, NOVA 3 and asphalt 8 and they didn't lag at all.\nMultitasking and ram management is awesome.  \n#Camera is said to be the key feature of this device and I can now accept that\nfact after trying it for over a week. Both the cameras did great job in\noutdoor and indoor artificial lighting conditions.  \nNow, let's move to the battery part, this smartphone comes with 3350 mAh\nbattery which is great in terms of daily usage and can easily last for about 1\ncomplete day with moderate use including 2 hours of gaming.  \nFingerprint sensor is astonishingly fast, just takes 0.3 seconds to recognize\nthe fingertips, which is damn fast as compared to note 4.  \nI personally recommend everyone to buy this smartphone, since the battery\nbackup is slightly lower than redmi note 4 but still 3350 mAh isn't bad. And\nI've seen some camera comparisons of both the phones and Note 4 has got really\npoor camera quality and no where near Honor 6x. Plus u should hear the #noise\nwhich Note 4 captures while recording videos.. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  \n  \nFolks be smart and don't get carried away with the Note 4 just for a few extra\nhours of battery backup. Trust me, you won't regret buying this smartphone.\n\n", "I bought this phone for Rs. 13,000 in Amazon Big Sale in the month of May.\nSince then it has been a joy ride with this gadget. Throw any parameter for\nbuying a mid range smartphone and you will find this one is there.  \n  \nProcessor+RAM - Enough to handle daily work and heavy graphics. Videos played\nare crisp and without any lag.  \n  \nBody - It has got a Metal Body which looks premium.  \n  \nScreen - 5.5\" screen is vibrant in colour with 2.5D curved glass. There is a\nscreen coating from company which is already pasted on screen.  \n  \nBattery - I am a very heavy user with WiFi, Data, Video, Instagram,\nFacebook..., hence I get one full day juice. User experience may vary.  \n  \nSound - Is decent but not very high. No headphones in the bundle.  \n  \nCamera - Main 12 mp IMX386 sensor takes beautiful images. The 2 mp monochrome\nsensor helps creating Bokeh effects. Twin camera is good setup on this phone.\nSelfie Camera is good but without 'Beauty Mode' it gives good photos. Some\nphoto samples are added here.  \n  \nUpdates - Phone came with Marshmallow and updated to Nougat in June. Oreo\nupdate is lined up for January 2018.  \n  \nService - Huawei has service centers in major cities in India. So far have not\ngot any problem with phone, so cannot comment on that.  \n  \nPrice - At 14,000, its a best deal you can get any time.\n\n", "\n\n\u00a0My mom's been using it for a few days after her Asus zenphone max(2gb ram)\nwas run over by a swift.  \nShe says the zenphone has better internet connectivity but the Honor 6x is\nfaster(3 GB ram).  \n  \nI did an unboxing video + a quick setting up video.  \n  \nI apologize for the bad video quality :/\n\n", "I had a very good impression for the phone during the initial days. when my\nphone display got shattered and went for service through one assist they took\nalmost 15 days. when i received the phone the phone was fine with a display.\nbut then the problems started.  \n1\\. Touch Issue  \n2\\. Contacts got shattered and merged with others.  \n3\\. When i touch a contact or type a alphabet it takes atleast 15-20 times\ntouch. When i touch some contact call get connected with some other contact  \n4\\. Volume of phone has gone down  \nWhen i approached the service center in Coimbatore the reply is for any\nwarranty phone they need to send the phone to Chennai for service and needs 15\nDays. I Couldn't able to understand the concept of Authorized Service Center.\n\n", "I've just been using it for 4 days. So far it's been working great. RAM\nmanagement is super. The quality of the phone is superior. I got it for 8K in\nGreatIndian Sale in January 2018.

SO BEST DEAL UNDER 10K  \n  \nIT HAS NO HEATING ISSUES...KIRIN IS GOOD  \n  \nNETWORK...AVERAGE...WORK FINE WITH JIO...SOME HAS SAID 2ND SIM IS ONLY\n2G...ITS NOT TRUE...NEEDNOT TO CHANGE THE SLOT  \nFOR 4G...RATHER CHANGE PRIORITY  \nSOUND IS LOW...YES ITS A SETBACK  \n  \nOVERALL WHAT MORE U NEED IN PHONES BELOW 10K....\n\n", "1)excellent camera (5/5)  \n2)very good performance (4.5/5)  \n3)good battery life (4/5)  \n4)excellent design (5/5  \n**overall value for money**  \nI'm using this device 7th months but no issue, I'm fully satisfied\n\n", "Very nice phone, good battery back up,\n\n", "It's amazing , super camera, Good battery, designs, I really like it, no heat\nissue, sounds also nice no problem\n\n", "I am using honor 6x and I found very cool features and it and I hope so you\nwill also buy it explore new features. But there are some problems that are it\ngets hanged when I turn on bluetooth or hauwai share and there is no more\nproblems I think it is the best phone I have used because it contains many\nfeatures such as I can call anybody which phone number is saved in my phone\nwithout opening the screen lock it is called quick calling I just need to say\nthe name of the people to call and there are many more features also which I\nhave not discovered yet so I suggest you to buy this phone because if you want\nto share anything you can share from your hotspot which is too better than\nBluetooth so I don't think so this is a big problem for me I hope so you will\nbuy that and explore some new features like magazine unlock which is too good\nin this phone if you want to see this magazine unlock teacher and how it works\nyou can watch it on YouTube or buy the phone and experience it.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 18 August 2017", "on 8 September 2017", "on 27 August 2017", "on 9 August 2017", "on 23 January 2018", "on 1 September 2017", "on 11 January 2018", "on 15 July 2017", "on 3 August 2017", "on 11 August 2017"], "reviewer": ["Vick", "Amazon Customer", "\u0938\u092e\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f", "GOWRI SHANKAR V", "anand", "Amazon Customer", "Pratap sutradhar ", "Amazon Customer", "Amazon Customer", "Sanchit talreja"]},

Don't expect extraordinary\nbackup.  \n3- display is good, compared with my bros iPhone 6s display, colour production\nis pretty comparable.  \n4-it has default process management feature, no need to install 3rd party app.  \n5-coming to \ud83d\udcf7, it is pretty good, takes very vivid pictures with good\ncolour(compare to mi A1 it takes more clear pics), it will not disappoint you\nbut not as much as it has been exaggerated.  \n  \nCons  \n1- design- bottom bezel is thick  \n2-hangs if you open too many apps like every other phone, ram management\ndoesn't handels this.  \n3-sometimes aaps hangs, need to restart the app.  \n4- on screen button has some +ve n -ve points, but it should be off screen.\n+Ve - we can rearrange and add 4th option of drawing notification bar.  \n-ve - always need to swipe up when u need these buttons.  \n  \nCons are very normal so we can ignore them.  \n  \nPS.

If one compares with Redmi or Motorola, Redmi costs cheaper\nwith same features, but the camera quality of Redmi isn't that good. Also it\nis quite difficult to get a hand on Redmi due to flash sale concept. Motorola\nhas good options but at a higher price. Advantage of Moto G series is quick\ncharging and dedicated memory slot, except that I believe no added features.\nTill now used it for 2 months, haven't got any issues with the phone.

Solid Build  \n2\\. Dual Camera  \n3\\. Octa-Core with 4GB/64 GB combo  \n4\\. Good Display  \n5\\. High on Memory Management efficiency(*Speed/Response test) - Easily beats\nLenovo K8, MI 4 by 21 seconds and 14 seconds respectively*  \n6\\. Don't need an Iron-Box feel when you're using a SMART-Phone  \n7\\. Decent Battery with 1.5 Days (4G + Browsing, Whatsapp, Gaming)  \n8\\. Budget is below 15k  \n  \nNow to my experience of both Pros-Cons  \n**Pros**  \nAs I had listed above, phone is very smooth, with beautiful UI & Memory\nmanagement. Camera is legendary for this price segment (*Thanks to Dual cam)\nFront cam is very good too.  \n  \nI am not an avid gamer over phone, but still I do have my own set of games :\nSim City, Cricket 2016, Plague Inc., Assassin's Creed - And be happy that the\nphone doesn't lag & heat!  \n  \nNow comes few cons:  \nFingerprint is not as fast as 0.3 seconds as they claim, it takes 2 shots to\nrecognize. And wetty fingers doesn't add good points to that.  \nGyroscope isn't good, so guaranteed you will not have a good VR experience. I\nam still fond of TheatreMax of my old Lenovo.  \n  \nBut.... You cant ask more off this little beast. My first Android phone was in\n2011 - Huwaei Ideos, since then I had experimented with a lot of buggers..\nAsus, iPhone 5C, MI, Lenovo. & My decision to go back to Huawei has paid me\nrich dividends.  \n  \nHuawei is the best in build is what I could say from my experience.  \n  \n-Hope this review helps!  \n  \n*And Thanks Amazon for a 16 hour Delivery!  \n  \nUPDATE:  \nSoftware:  \nThe phone is still a beast in every aspect with two software updates to the\naccommodate the latest Android version on your device.  \n  \nHeating Issue:  \nHeating?? What's that? Have installedPES2017, WWE2k17 and no lags at all and\nit doesn't get heated so much ! For me... Thats a WOOWWW Moment having been\nused to Lenovo previously.  \n  \nMemory Management & Swiftness  \nAs I said, Dont bother running heavy apps! Honor memory management is a jaw\ndropping feature it manages processors smooth and no lags at all!  \n  \nOne thing I hate -or-is hyped too much!  \nThe Fingerprint sensor.... It isnt that great! It takes 2-3 times for it to\nrecognize! Which gets me pissed off! But it is super fast in unlocking though!  \n  \nCamera -  \nBack - Dual is a boon ! Front is decent ... shall post few pics soon...\neverythin I have taken is personal so far ! :-p Also, I guess this the only\nphone to have Front cam panaroma in this price segment!...

Volte support for Jio sim is to provided and call quality\nis excellent.\n\n", "I am using this phone for around 2 weeks now, and I used Moto X Style, Mi4i\nand iphone 4 in the recent past. H6X is a very good phone under 15k.  \nPros:  \n1\\. Very good back camera, it has many features including Bookeh effect\n(blurring the background), DSLR features like lighting effect, taking pictures\nin the pitch dark without even using the flash and so on.  \n2\\. The Front camera is also good in normal lighting condition but does not\nhave flash.  \n3\\. Battery back up is superb, would run a full day even with moderately heavy\nusage (gaming, 4G, GPS, music, movies etc.) and charges also quickly.  \n4\\. The Kirin soc is very good, no lagging, no heating. I play COC, Boom\nBeach, Kill Shot etc. pretty often and did not feel any heating issues.  \n5\\. The EMUI is very good and has lots of custmoisation option. Personally, I\nfeel it is somewhat better than Xiaomi's MIUI.  \n6\\. Display is good as well, as it is FHD. Decent sun-light readability and\nnight reading mode to reduce the blue lights.  \n7\\. Though the display is 5.5 inch, it is pretty much easier to use with one\nhand. I can do it even with my short and fat Chimpz fingers. Also, the phone\nis much slimmer.  \n8\\. It has 15 months warranty as against the usual 12 months by other\nmanufacturers.  \n9\\. The Finger Print Sensor is quite good and I am pretty satisfied with its\nresponse.  \nCons:  \n1\\. The loud speakers are not that loud and clear. Though one can hear the\nring tones from another nearby room, but in a crowded place one may miss a\ncall or two. For music lovers, I guess with a good pair of head-phones, one\ncan overcome this issue.  \n2\\. The metallic body is bit slippery, especially in summer as the hand sweats\nand the phone tends to slip from hand. I am using a back-cover to overcome\nthis.  \n3\\. The display is not Gorilla glass, so need to use tempered glass. The phone\nis provided with a factory fitted tempered glass by the manufacturer but it is\nprone to keep the finger marks so need to wipe every now and then.  \n4\\. There's a minute problem with the contact search option. Sometime, when I\ntry to search some contacts and try to type the name, it does not detect the\ninput. But, when I close the contact and reopen it again and search, it\nreflects the name. Seems it is a software glitch which would eventually get\nsolved when they would provide SW update.  \n  \nThis is what I feel of the Honor 6X after using it for more than 2 weeks and\ntruly I am loving it. What more one can expect at 14k.\n\n", "It's a good product. Recieved on time. Good packaging and delivery.  \n  \nThis phone is amazing feels good in hand. Gives a feel of iPhone.

This was just within 7 days of purchase..so\nwent to the service centre and luckily the phone got repaired without extra\ncharge,but took 10 days to get it back!\n\n", "After using phone for one week..i struggled between redmi4 and honor6x ..Main\nreason to buy this CAMERA ..becoz camera and battery are the most people's\nrequirements..go for pros and cons ...  \nCONS-  \n1.Biggest problem in this honor device is..Audio output..its not only the\nvolume but also audio output itself is baaaad..i am a audiophile..i thought to\ncorrect it by equalizers but its a time waste ..so if u luv music u will get\nhurt by the honor audio output..i have used senheiser/sony/skull candy ..but\nhonors audio output beats their excellency nd give u the horrible output  \n2.next all are minor cons- some times glitches  \nhappen,hang one for 1or 2secnds when there is heavy functioning  \n3.In camera in normal mode also..the more the clarity in the middle grids..the\nmore the blurr in the corners...corners are so blurred in the images..dnt knw\nwhy ..  \n4\\. I just really dnt like the branding in front wasting so much space..  \n5.let look into some NO - NO ir (infra red )facility + in redmi devices, No\ndouble tap sensor, No fast charging its usb type B only ...dont use while\ncharging..back is metallic one so u will feel definitely heat .. after\ncharging remove the pin keep for 5-10 mints then use ..  \nNow PROS Which u will like more  \n1.BATTERY-..NEVER EXPECTED This from honor ..its a 3400 mah battery ...but it\ncan make ur whole day ..screen on time with mobile data like heavy usage -\neasily u can get 13-14 hrs a day..for rest if ur a just popup visitor u can\nlast for 1nd half day easily... specifically should mention about the power\nsaving modes  \n2 modes - power saving mode& ultra power saving mode -excellent ways for\nbattery life  \n3.RAM management- u wnt believe this ..actually i got 3 gb ram one ..in my mi\ntab when i open about 10 apps the ram will be about jst 100 mb left and phone\nwill be slow...but i was shocked with honor ...i nearly opened about 15\napps..its still gives 1.8gb freee..and when u open these apps they wont reload\nalso...this might be the main reason for such a long battery life also..i was\nso impressed  \n3.CAMERA- As u all knw it is at its best..best thing is front cam is so good\nand in artificial light alsoit gives u the best output.. but dnt expect beyond\nwith this..its a 13mp cam only it cant make miracles in CLARITY but showcases\nthe pic in beautiful way ..up on zooming its all grain u get ..but its the\nbest camera i have used around 10k range..best for photography people  \nConclusion-BADLY needed batterylife and photography..go for it  \nBut if u luv music - think twice /thrice before buying it ..\n\n", "I have used lot of phones, but I love this phone so much.
