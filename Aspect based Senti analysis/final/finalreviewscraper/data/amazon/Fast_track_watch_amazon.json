If you have a wrist of 6inch or lower this is the only\nFastrack watch that will fit in your wrist. Anything over case diameter of\n40mm will be too big for your watch.

It's difficult to see the time under dull lighting as the needle is\nsilver and blends in with the black dial. Having said that, I think this is\nthe best watch I've purchased off late and will definitely recommend it for\nthe price. Feels very premium and a niche product.\n\n", "Product is not much good.
