My stock answer is that none are perfect, all have their drawbacks, and\nthe handful of top models may fit you well and work great -- or they may not.  \n  \nBose's SoundSport Wireless, the company's first Bluetooth sports headphone,\nisn't perfect either, but it may just be the best Bluetooth sports headphone\ncurrently out there.  \n  \nI mean you don't jam the earbud into your ear and completely seal off your ear\ncanal (that type of headphone is referred to as a \"noise-isolating\" in-ear\nheadphone). Thanks to Bose's eartips, which come in three sizes -- small,\nmedium, large -- the bud sits loosely in your ear yet remains securely in\nplace.  \n  \nThe SoundSport Wireless comes with three sizes of ear tips.  \n  \nThis model is equipped with a special sport version of the tips that's\ndifferent from the tips included with Bose's earlier in-ear headphones, so\nthey aren't interchangeable. I should also point out that because the\nearpieces extend out from your ears you'll probably have some trouble wearing\nthese under certain helmets.  \n  \nThe ear pieces are somewhat bulky, but not so bulky to feel heavy on your\nears. However, if there's a criticism of this headphone's design, it's that\nthe ear pieces could protrude out a little less and be more discrete-looking.\nEasier said then done, of course -- today's battery technology is holding back\nminiaturization efforts.  \n  \nRival headphones -- such as Jaybird's X2 and Freedom, Beats' Powerbeats 2\nWireless and Monster's Adidas Sport Adistar -- give you the ability to shorten\nthe cord length (or cinch up the cord) for those who want to wear the cord\ncloser to the neck. With this headphone, you can't adjust the cord length, but\nwhat Bose has done is provide a clip you can hook on to the back of your shirt\n(at the top) to keep the cord from flopping about. It's a smart design and I\nthought it worked well; the cord remained fairly stable, even while I was\nrunning.  \n  \nThe only downside to the floating-fit, open design is that ambient sound does\nleak in: this isn't a great headphone for noisy environments. (If that's your\npreference, Bose's upcoming QuietControl 30 is a wireless model that features\nactive noise-canceling.) But if you're out running or biking, you'll be able\nto hear cars coming, which is why a lot of runners and bikers prefer their\nheadphones to have open designs.  \n  \nAs you might expect, the headphone is sweat- and water-resistant and there's\nan inline mic and remote that lets you skip songs, adjust volume, and take and\nmake calls. Bose is touting its quality as a headset for making calls, as well\nas how reliable the Bluetooth connection is. I can attest to experiencing only\nminimal Bluetooth hiccups and was satisfied with how it performed as a\nheadset, though the QuietControl 30 and QuietComfort 35 offer superior headset\nperformance. Those models have noise-reduction features that muffle ambient\nsound, including wind and street noise.  \n  \nJust as importantly I had no trouble pairing and repairing the headphone with\nmy iPhone 6S and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (the Bose features near-field\ncommunication tap-to-pair technology for devices like the Samsung that support\nthis feature). I also simultaneously paired it with my iPhone 6S and MacBook\nAir and had no trouble switching between the two when a call came in as I was\nwatching a video on the computer.  \n  \nBose Connect, a free app for Android and iOS, allows you to manage your\npairing list, upgrade the firmware and change the auto power off settings (the\nheadphone powers down if you don't use it for a certain length of time, which\nis a good battery-saving feature). When you turn on the headphones, a female\nvoice alerts you how much battery life is remaining and with which devices\nyou're paired. That information is also available in the app.  \n  \nBattery life for the SoundSport is rated at 6 hours, which is fairly decent\nfor this type of small headphone (though not great overall), and 5 hours for\nthe SoundSport Pulse. Both SoundSport wireless headphones come with a simple\nneoprene carrying case, but Bose will also sell an accessory case that has a\nbuilt-in battery for on-the-go charging that'll cost $50. That battery case\nprovides three full charges, or up to 18 hours of battery life.  \n  \nBose will sell a separate accessory case that has a built-in rechargeable\nbattery for 3000 rupees.  \n  \nI used the the SoundSport Wireless for over a week, taking it to the gym,\nusing it on the streets of Mumbai and doing two runs with it on Lodha Palava.\nI used the large eartips and was able to get a comfortable, secure fit.  \n  \nWith a lot of in-ear sports headphones, I find myself having to make little\nadjustments to relieve some discomfort or get a more secure fit, especially\nwhile running, but with this headphone the adjustments I had to make were\nminimal. They were easy to put on and take off, they powered on and paired\nquickly to my phone, and worked as well as any Bluetooth headphone I've used.  \n  \nThe sound quality is very good for an in-ear sports Bluetooth headphone.\nThere've been some complaints about it not playing loud enough, but I didn't\nhave that issue with the iPhone 6S or Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I tested it with.\n(Bluetooth performance on computers tends to be a little dodgy and perhaps\nsome of the volume complaints are related to computer connectivity.)  \n  \nThe headphone doesn't sound as good as Bose's SoundTrue Ultra wired\nheadphones, which I like a lot and offers cleaner, more dynamic sound, with\nbetter defined bass. But that's the nature of Bluetooth. You lose a little\nsomething. In the case of the SoundSport Wireless, the loss isn't huge.\nThere's some clarity missing (the highs are a little recessed), but you get\nlots of bass and the midrange sounds pretty natural and warm. It's also a\nfairly open-sounding headphone.  \n  \nWhat's interesting about the sound is that this headphone seems to be\noptimized for outside use. Inside, in a quiet room, the bass can sound a\nlittle bloated, which gives everything a slightly dull edge. But when you're\nwalking around outside, the bass sounds toned down because it's competing with\nambient noise, whether it's the wind or traffic or whatever. If you didn't\nhave that extra bass the headphone would sound thin outside. The way it's\ntuned, it sounds smoother and better balanced outdoors.  \n  \nI didn't think it sounded better than the Jaybird Freedom, which also delivers\nexcellent sound for an in-ear Bluetooth headphone -- though that model costs\n33 percent more. But it bests the Beats PowerBeats 2 Wireless, Plantronics'\nBackBeat Fit and Monster's Adidas Sport Adistar. The latter two models cost\nless than the Bose.  \n  \nAll that said, what ultimately makes the Bose the superior headphone and easy\nto recommend is its fit and comfort level. No, it's not perfect -- and it\nwon't be a perfect fit for everyone -- but it's one of the few \"premium\" in-\near Bluetooth headphones that I think will work for the vast majority who buy\nit.  \n  \nThe SoundSport Wireless' highlights:  \n  \nAvailable in two colors at launch (black, aqua). Choose your pick!  \nPrice: 13k  \n6 hours of battery life  \nWater- and sweat-resistant  \nAuto-power off feature  \nAccessory charging case costs around 3000 extra  \nWorks with Bose's free Connect app for Android and iOS devices  \nNFC tap-to-pair technology for devices that supports it.  \n  \nNote:  \nSoundSport Pulse Wireless with built-in heart-rate monitor that comes in red\nand has 5 hours of battery life  \n  \nGood: The SoundSoundSport Wireless is a very comfortable in-ear wireless\nBluetooth sports headphone that's sweat-resistant and sounds great. The\nearphones fit securely in your ears thanks to winged tips. The headphone works\ndecently as a headset for making cell-phone calls and has an auto-off feature\nto preserve battery life.  \n  \nBad: The ear pieces protrude noticeably from your ears (they're a little bulky\nthat don't feel heavy); battery life tops out at 6 hours.  \n  \nCrux: The Bose SoundSport Wireless is the most comfortable, best overall in-\near Bluetooth sports headphone you can buy right now.\n\n", "Very frustrating experience with Bose, TWICE IN A ROW.  \nBought earphones and just after the warranty period, the cable started to\ncorrode.  \nBose suggested me to buy even better version which can handle Dust, Sunlight\nand Sweat, guess what ?? Same thing happened !!  \nEven my 500 rs earphone had better life than this.  \nNow I will have to put more money to buy another. But I WILL NEVER GO TO BOSE\nEVER AGAIN !!  \n  \nWASTED 25,000 IN TOTAL !!  \n  \nHATED HOW THEY HANDLE THEIR CLIENTS.  \n  \nMOST IMP : BOSE DID NOT HELP ME IN ANY CASE, THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THEIR\nCUSTOMERS.  \n  \nTOTALLY WASTAGE OF MONEY. INVEST IN SOME OTHER BRAND.\n\n", "I am using this headphone for last couple of days. Please find my review below  \n  \n1\\. Packaging - the packaging is top class. Like BOSE. But, it\u2019s a bit big in\ncomparison to the product size. However, they have given the extra buds to fit\nyour ears and also a small pouch, which is very nice and has a hook which you\ncan loop it to your trouser hook or to your bag etc. It also includes a\ncharging cable but no charging plug  \n  \n2\\. The look and feel - It has a anti tangle cable which is good. The colour I\nhave is black, so it looks pretty run of the mill and dull. The headphone has\na clip which you can remove and replace depending on where you want to clip\nit. The earphones are large in comparison to the ones you get in the market.\nWhen you put it inside your ear, the outer part (where BOSE is written)\nprotrudes and make look a bit odd by no big deal. The material is rubbery and\non the right part of the earbud, you have the power switch as well as the\ncharging micro USB port. On the left bud, there is nothing. the cable has a\nmic as well as volume up/down button. Which is bit unusual and rubbery. But it\nworks well, just that, you need to press it hard to make it work. But, you\ntend to get used to it. Its not one of those soft touch ones.  \n  \n3\\. The pairing and BOSE app - There is a BOSE app (I downloaded the iOS app).\nThe BOSE connect app shows you the battery percentage and you can also control\nthe volume from the app. It also has features like product help, feedback,\npolicy/settings and a link to connect to bose.com. It also gives you the\noption to activate or deactivate the voice prompt option and prompt language.\nIt also enables you to share music between 2 BOSE headphones (Bluetooth ones I\nguess, since I haven't tried). It pairs well and fast. You can also get\nmultiple devices paired at one time.  \n  \n4\\. The music quality - I have tried few Bluetooth headsets before, including\nnoise cancelling bose wired headset. I must say, the quality is very good, if\nnot excellent. The bass is superb and it tells you, you are listening to a\nhigh end device.  \n  \n5\\. Battery - The battery is just OK. From the time, I paired the headphone\ntill the time I got the low battery alert, it took me approx. 9 hours. And I\nwould have used the headphone for approx. 2 hours of talk time paired to my\nphone. Haven't tried with music only listening time, but, I guess it will be\nmore at a stretch.  \n  \n6\\. Ease of use while walking / running - The earbuds fits quite well and you\nhave choice of size, which comes part of the package. While walking, it just\nstays in the ear with no fear of falling off. If you clipped it to the back of\nyour collar (which while walking isn't needed), its better, but without it\nalso, it\u2019s pretty firm to both your ears. While running, you may clip it or\nwithout. I did a 2kms run with the Bluetooth earphone plugged in and I would\nsay, almost all the time, I felt it to be in place with once or twice pushing\nit back in more from the perspective of being sure as the earbuds showed no\nindication of falling off due to running. So, a thumbs up here. If you are\nable to clip it well, then it will stay in place even better while running.\nJust that, if you clip it to the back of your collar, the shirt tends to get\npulled as you run, and it may make you feel as if the earbuds are getting\nlose. So, get the clipping right, and you may not have issues. It's water\nresistant but to what extent I wouldn't know since didn't test it.  \n  \n7\\. Final Verdict - Bose is expensive. So, you can get a shade lower quality\noutput by paying less than half. But, then BOSE is also about brand and also\nfor those, you are very particular about finest quality audio (which may not a\nbig deal for music while you are walking or running). Overall, if you can\nspend for a BOSE, go for it, but if you are ready for a slight compromise, you\nmay remain happy for an earphone half the price.\n\n", "I\u2019ve been using Bose products for a while and I\u2019ve always awed at their\nquality - both in terms of build quality and sound.  \nSame is the case with Bose Soundsport Wireless! They deliver punchy sound\nnotes along with good base. You won\u2019t find better bluetooth in-ear earphones\nat this price range. They may look bulky, but they sit comfortably in your\nears with the Stay Hear+ tips and never fall off while working out. They don\u2019t\ncancel out the ambient noise, but that\u2019s a plus point while running / jogging\nin the roads, making a person aware of the surroundings. It can connect to two\ndevices simultaneously, thus, you can jump from one device to another\neffortlessly!  \n  \nOverall, a good buy and a value for money! You might want to look into Jaybird\nX3\u2019s too to make an informed choice.\n\n", "At first I was not happy , though I had wasted 13275bucks in getting a sound -\nany my previous leaf earphones of 2000 we\u2019re giving me same sound and better\nfit . It took 30 minutes to upgrade the firmware - now the sound was\nunanticipated unmatchable- now that\u2019s what you call the charm of Bose\nearphones. I won\u2019t say the fit is great - it\u2019s not . But sound of Bose will\nnot betray you - every beat of the sound will have an impact . But this - to\nhear every treble and beat .\n\n", "Actually I'm Sony Fan for frequency and details  \nThe Bose sound is perfect, powerful, extended bass and make music sound lively\nbest sounding wirless in ears.  \nBOSE SOUNDSPORTS WIRLESS IN EAR  \n  \nTHE BOTTOM LINE: Strong wirless performance.  \nThis earphone perfect for running and style.  \nEverything song personally EQ system of any volumes . The bose sound is\nenlightened and high but no pressure ur ears.  \nBass:10*true and alive  \nTreble:7*mostly natural  \nVocal:10*lifelike  \ncomfort:10 *bose significant earbuds long time listening  \nverdict: value for money.  \nProblem:7* less battery life  \nMy suggest :Bose is Bose.

Then everythings becomes wow!  \nNote :depends on ur device\n\n", "Bought these pair of headphones in a real hurry as a birthday present for one\nof my friend , although I was researching about the product since past couple\nof weeks.  \nThe real disappointment came when I was made aware that you could really not\nget a hands experience with the quality of the sound. And also build initially\ndid not impress me .  \nBut when the moment came , I was taken a back, I didn't mind the price nor my\ndecision after that.  \nBrilliantly engineered sound system fits well.\n\n", "These are the most comfortable bluetooth earphones.  \nOnce worn we totally forget its physical presence and sound just images in\nfront of us. The sound quality is one of the best out of many blueetooth\nearphones i have heard so far. when it comes to comfort, its the bose\n(universal opinion and i do amend). Though sony (nwz-s615) is cheaper, having\nan option at home, I always pick this bose against the sony everyday to use.\nIt would have been more comfortable if the earphones were as thin as the bose\n1st gen in-ears, which i could wear at night, sleep and roll with it and wake\nup next day to find it in my ears (not falling) only after the wires pull\n(meaning you dont know its sitting in your ears, its that much comfortable).\nSince the bose blueetooth ear buds are bulky, they protrude and hinder when\nyou roll over.  \nApart from that these are one of the best choice. I already have the bose 1st\nin-ears which still my 1st choice over the many many renounced earphones i\nhave and the customer service that i experiences when its (1st gen bose in-\near)wire were almost broke(though working) did a very good job of exchanging\nwith new one's for 2000rs(may be the cost of re-wiring)  \nSo absolutely the best choice, but the pricing should be half of what they ask\nfor...\n\n", "I have been using BOSE products from past 7 years and this is my recent\npurchase. As a music lover, I tried couple of other brands and I have to say\nthis. I personally think Apple ear set does similar job as this product does\nin terms of quality of sound. The only difference lies in the minor musical\nsounds which you can pick in BOSE but not in other ear set. To this small\nadvantage, I think it is priced very high.  \n  \nI requested to return the product as headset never stayed on and was popping\nout as I was jogging. Highly disappointed with this.\n\n", "The product is good but not as per my requirements:  \nPros:  \n1\\. Sound quality is good, which is obvious, it's BOSE  \n2\\. Even though they looks big but when you'll wear them they are very light.  \n3\\. Pretty good for gym.  \n  \nCons:  \n  \n1\\. You can not use them for cycling and motorcycle, due to it's big size  \n2\\. As i mentioned mentioned \"cycling\" above because there's too much wind\nnoise coming when you are riding a cycle or a motorcycle.  \n3\\. they do not cancel outside noise, you will still be able to hear people\naround you, it can be considered good or bad to some, but for me, i did't\nreally liked it, as at gym you will be able to hear other noise too except the\nmusic.  \n  \nOver all it's good, they are meant for gym but if you are looking for\nsomething to use during biking or motorcycle multipurpose, it should not be\nyour choice!\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 19 July 2017", "on 13 March 2017", "on 27 June 2017", "on 31 August 2017", "on 13 January 2018", "on 14 January 2018", "on 25 December 2017", "on 15 November 2017", "on 2 December 2017", "on 12 April 2017"], "reviewer": ["Arka Bhattacharjee", "Rishi", "Mee Mumbaikar", "Siddhant Bahuguna", "Mohammad Shariq Irshad", "Sajal Mandal", "Yashodar", "Sai", "Ramanuja Swamy Saketha", "Gourav G."]},

The bose connect app is a plus as it opens up ways to alter/adjust and\nupdate your earphones. The app is userfriendly and interactive.  \n-These aren't for bass lover's, however they give you an accurate sound with decent amount of bass for that workout pump.  \n\\- Probably by far the most confortable wirless earphones. Sometimes you don't\neven realise they are there.  \n  \nThings i didn't like:-  \n\\- The battery life is about 6 hours. When you spend this kind of money, you\ndo expect a little more for your buck. Other wirleless earphones in this price\nrange are offering more for the same amount.  \n\\- The charging case would have been an awesome addition if given with these,\nbut unfortunately they cose another 3200/-\n\n", "First things first, Amazon delivered this product well on-time and when this\nwas not available anywhere else in India. This is the most precious and\npractical possession in my Bose portfolio.  \nThis was the first wireless earphone category offering by Bose and when not\navailable in stores last few months, the rumours were they are going to\nredesign. But the actual reason when I see the same product back on shelves is\nthe extreme demand which made the supply a big constraint.  \n  \nPros :  \n\\- Extremely user friendly be it the way we can hang in ears, to pairing.  \n\\- Sweat and Tangle Free. Wearing this on the go is a swift and stays the same\neven after an intense 2 hour workout.  \n\\- Battery life - atleast 10 hours of continuous play. Comes atleast couple of\ndays when used moderately.  \n\\- Last but not the least, Bose mark sound quality.  \n\\- The clip in the back is very thoughtful and functional.  \nCons :  \n\\- The voice over help interrupts an active call by announcing the full\nsentence and name of the caller. Though this option can be disabled.  \n\\- Yes, it is little bulky in looks on ears, but it never falls off very\neasily.  \n\\- Can pair only 2 devices at once.\n\n", "I wanted to buy headphone that can connect with two devices simultaneously. It\nshould connect to my phone for playing music etc & should also connect to my\nwindows 7 laptop for skype meetings. This headphone does it with out any break\nat all.  \n  \nNow i can freely listen my music and whenever there is a skype call it will\nautomatically ask you to pick up skype call. once call is done it starts\nplaying my music back.  \n  \nConnectivity is smooth. works very well and connects easily. battery life is\nok but its very new for me to comment of that. charging time is also under 2\nhours. which is great.  \n  \nI only found one issue that it doesnt have noise cancellation. so you cant\nhave calls in very noisy environment as it picks up all the sounds around you.\nbut if you are taking calls from office & home (less noise ofcours). than you\nwill not find any issues.  \n  \npackaging was good and delivered on time as promised by amazon.\n\n", "I became a headphone/earphone user due to my work and extensive travels. I\nexperimented with a various brands - Sony, Phillips, Audio Technica,\nSennheiser and Bose. I quickly realised that the in-ear earphones suited my\npurpose the best. So I gave up all my over-ear headphones, including my Bose\nSoundTrue.  \n  \nFor a very long time I relied on the Sennheiser CX 180 Street II In-Ear\nHeadphone (Black) and then moved to the Sennheiser CX 275 S In -Ear Universal\nMobile Headphone With Mic (Black) - both i loved very much, great quality.  \n  \nAfter some deliberation i decided to move on to a wireless headphones and was\ntorn between the Bose and the Jaybird but finally chose the Bose.  \n  \nI have been using the SoundSport for the past couple of months now and its\nsimply sublime.  \n  \nSound Quality, Balance of treble and base, Comfort, Fit and Looks - it scores\na 5/5 in every aspect.  \n  \nIt connects without any hassle to all my Apple products and is a perfect match\nfor the sound quality that iTunes Music is capable to deliver.  \n  \nIf you are wearing this while working, you will forget that you are wearing\nsomething in your ear - total immersion!  \n  \nThe only regret is that the battery could have been better, it says 6 hours\nbut it gives between 4-5 hours.\n\n", "This is really good.
