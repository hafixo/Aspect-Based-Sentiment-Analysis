First of all thanks to\nAmazon for sharp on time delivery and nice packaging. After delivery\nsurprisingly on next day received a call fron Inalsa cust care about demo.\nProcess was smooth and demo person was quite prompt and polite. Coming to the\nfood processor, Here are some pros and cons.  \nPros.  \n1\\. Motor is powerful and does not make much noise.  \n2\\. Attachments are quite handy and useful, especially atta kneading, finger\nchips cutter and chopper are very effective.  \n3\\. Price is very much low as compared to other products.  \n4\\. Additinal attachments are easily available in the market.  \n  \nCons,  \n1\\. Main processor body could have been little more smoother. Some burrs are\nvisible.  \n2\\. So many attachments take some space to be stored. But it has nothing to do\nwith product.\n\n", "Extremely poor built quality, handle of main jar came off during shipping\nitself, plastic quality is bad and edges rough and smelly. Disappointed by\nquality of product and packaging (low quality cardboard, extremely bad design\nof packaging), Amazon too did not take any precautions during shipping.\n\n", "I bought this product for 3999/- which is one of the the best prices I could\nget. Moreover, my family is using Inalsa - Food Processor (older variant) for\npast 18 Years and still it works great. Now coming to the overall feedback:  \n  \nDelivery:  \n\\- Amazon delivered in real quick time. I got the product on 3 day after my\norder. The packaging was great and steps were taken to ensure that nothing\nhappens as it is a highly fragile product.  \n  \nPros  \n\\- All in One machine  \n\\- Quickly can get the work done. So delicious cooking is more easier now.  \n\\- Plastic and built in quality is perfect.  \n\\- Blades are just awesome does not require a change and are of Stainless\nSteel  \n\\- Overload Protector comes in very handy  \n\\- Nice Safety features  \n  \nCons  \n\\- Maybe at this price none with respect to the pros/benefits.  \n  \nRest the food processor is worth buying and specially when you want it and are\ngetting a good deal.\n\n", "Fantastic product.

Now I can do every of my work in seconds without strain.\n\n", "An Inalsa Fiesta Food Processor was delivered to me on 8 Jan., 2018. I waited\nover a week to start using it because the processor bowl could not be removed\nfrom the base to be washed, as the joint was stuck.  \nRecently, I tried grinding idli batter in the bowl and found the consistency\nunsatisfactory even after repeated attempts. I therefore tried the liquidizer\nbowl and found it doing a better job. However, after the first lot was done,\nthe liquidizer bowl refused to get dislodged, as of it was stuck to something.\nThe machine could still be operated when in locked position. As I suspected\nthat the base of the liquidizer may have got heated, although I ran it\nintermittently, only for 6 minutes, I waited and tried again and again, till\nit finally came unstuck. However, I found scraps of white plastic at the base.\nIt continued to work for the remaining lots of batter, but I am disgusted that\nthis should happen so early. Two people have to work in unison to dislodge the\nprocessor bowl from the base.\n\n", "I bought this food processor around 5 days ago from amazon India at the cheap\nprice of 3779 only . I purchased this product mainly to make all the kitchen\ntasks easy like atta kneading aur shredding etc. The products does what\nexactly what it claims. I used this product for the first time for kneading\natta but I was not very successful as it became quite wet.But as I followed\nthe instruction CD available with it and the videos available on youtube, I\nbecame master in it. Thus, I would like to suggest you to go through all the\ninstructions before using it and you will be amazed by the results. The food\nprocessor really makes every task like a children's play. We can also take out\nhealthy juices in 2 minutes.It also comes with many safety features.At the\nlast, I would like to tell you that this is the best food processor available\nin this price range and you should definitely go for it.
