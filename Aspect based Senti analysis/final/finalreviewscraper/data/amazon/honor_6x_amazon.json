Awesome battery life  \n3\\. Quick charging  \n4\\. 64 GB Memory is enough  \n5\\. Fingerprint Sensor is very accurate.  \n6\\. Multi tasking is very smooth.  \n7\\. Additional uses of fingerprint sensor like swipe left right to change\npicture when you have opened the gallery. Swipe up down to open notifications\nand swipe right to clear notifications.  \n8\\. Front camera takes pretty good selfies.  \n  \nCONS :  \n1\\. Hybrid slot  \n2\\. No USB C type cable  \n3\\. No front flash  \n  \nVerdict: If you are confused between redmi note 4 or honor 6x then you must go\nfor honor. If you think about price then it is only 1k more than note and on\nthe occasion of so many sales on Amazon you can get it for 13k which is\nsimilar to redmi note 4. Redmi note 4 only have more mah of battery but in all\nother departments honor 6x completely outclass RMN4. And when it comes to\nbattery also it has quick charge which takes less time when it comes to\ncharging. So without having a 2nd thought you can go for this phone if you are\nlooking for a solid smartphone with pretty good camera, battery, performance\nand after sale services. Huawei(honor) is a more established brand then xiaomi\nand have more number of service center in India so you will get better after\nsale services.\n\n", "I am totally satisfied with this phone.

Its speakers are not bad as described in the other reviews. The sound\nquality is not excellent but is up to the mark.  \n3\\. Performance of this device is very good.

I charge this phone once in 1.5 days.  \n  \nCons.  \nThe only con is that it has a hybrid sim slot.

I am\nkinda disappointed on the camera. Maybe i expected too much.  \n2\\. The screen quality is good. Its 1920x1080 resolution which is great. The\nsunlight readability is also fine. Overall i am happy with the 2.5D screen.\nThe videos look great.  \n3\\. The sound quality is not good. The bass is worse. The high and lows are\nalso medium. The speaker is not good for listening to music.  \n4\\. The battery works fine. It gives a full day usage with normal use. I am\npretty satisfied with its battery.  \n5\\. The performance is not great in Android 6.0. But after upgrading to\nAndroid 7.0 the performance is superb. You can run any high def. games\nsmoothly on this device. The memory management is also good in this phone.  \n6\\. This phone doesn't include headphone with it.

I\nlove this phone. I'm a guy whose priority for buying an android phone is the\ncamera. And I can tell you I'm really satisfied with this one. in fact I did\ncompare with my cousin's dual camera phone of the same range. but this phone\nstands out excellent in almost all aspects.  \nThe battrey backup is awesome as it gives you options to actually control the\napps permissions to run in background so in that way you can save a lot of\npower.  \nWith all the negative comments about this phone, I don't find them worthy,\nit's all about how you use it and how you customize it.\n\n", "Superb phone, long lasting battery, excellent camera with document scanner\nfacility and manual mode.

There were news about oreo update confirmed for\nhonor 6x with reffence of some company person's statement. After this price\nwas droped. and then after few months 7x was released. Looking at this, it was\nvery clear that news of \"confirmed oreo update for honor 6x\" by the end of\njanuary 2016, was a marketing stratergy to clear the stock of 6x befor release\nof 7x. Company was not openly denying the oreo update to 6x till now because\nthey don't want to affect the 7x sale. Not giving major android os update is\nimportant negative point for any company.

Coming to battery life, with 4g data onn its provides a decent back up.\nFunctions like app twin for fb and whatsapp is great. Fingerprint scanner is\nalso pretty fast. At this cost the camera functions are too damn cool. With a\nsteady hand or tripod the night mode is awesome and the star track too.  \nRest every things sets this phone way ahead from the rest at the same price\ngroup.\n\n", "After 4 days of use. This device is flawless and I'm loving it. Display is at\npar. Cameras are extraordinary better than redmi note 4. I'm not a gamer but\nmultitasking is at the best. This won't annoy you. Got it @9999 from Amazon.\nFound some kinda delay in delivery but at the hands of courier department.\nHave been using continuesly since the launch of redmi 1s till last thursday.  \nCons;  \nMiss the loud sound of redmi as this device occupies lil bit lower sound.  \nAnother con is while placing a call this ui doesn't hv the option call\nrecording in the dialing interface which is a major drawback for me. However\ncall quality is very nice, you can't face that much issues even in noisy\ntraffic.  \nOne thing to suggest amazon team is please develop option of sending invoice\nof the item to the customer after delivery like flipkart does.\n\n", "Using this phone for last 6 months. I faced absolutely no problem with the\ndevice. Very smooth and fluid Android experience. Phone got better and better\nwith new updates. The camera is best in this price segment.\n\n", "It's good phone but there is a drawback. If you are a selfie lover and you are\ngoing to purchase it due to it's camera quality please keep following issue in\nyour mind:  \n  \nThere is no flash in selfie camera. It use your phone's light to use selfie in\ndark-light which isn't sufficient.  \n  \nBy the camera quality is amazing and you will love the photos of it.\n\n", "At first, I thought of return the phone as it came with Android 6.0\nmarshmallow and with some network issues . But, after updating to Android 7.0\nNougat and EMU 5.1 Version all the issues are neutralized and it is simply\namazing.... Self cam images are so beautiful. Little bit disappointing with\nback cam images. No heating issues while charging and playing games. WORTHY\n\n", "Bought it for 7999 on great indian sale.  \nUsed for 1 month  \n  \nNice display, better than rn4  \nPerformance is great at thas price....hangs 1 time i dont know why but it\nfreezes for almost 1 minute and then automatically restarted and become\nnormal.  \nBattery performance is good could have been better.  \nRear camera is takes some good shots in low light also. But I dont like the\nfrnt camera my sis rn3 frnt camera is better than this and my previous Zenfone\n2 laser. Call quality and network reception is good. EMUI is great better than\nmy previous zenui.. people says miui is better but I dont like miui.  \nSound quality through speaker is not great as redmi phones but better than\nmany other phones. Headphone sound quality is better than previous zenfone. Rn\n4 build quality seems good than this.  \nOverall at 7999 it is very good deal. Buy if got less than 9000 otherwise go\nfor redmi note 5.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 2 September 2017", "on 26 November 2017", "on 19 October 2017", "on 20 August 2017", "on 27 July 2017", "on 17 December 2017", "on 12 October 2017", "on 7 March 2018", "on 24 December 2017", "on 2 March 2018"], "reviewer": ["TJ...", "Alambe Haiding", "Pratik", "Taru", "Anirban Datta", "Ghulam Ahmad", "Yashwant Chougale", "Sachan.Rishabh", "g suresh", "Amazon Customer"]},

Kirin 655 rocks.  \n-> Battery life is decent 1 and half days on a single charge and normal usage. Phone charges in about 2hrs 15 minutes.  \n->All sensors are present and pedometer is a bonus.  \n->EMUI 5 is feature rich, elegant and snappy.  \n->The screen has nice viewing angles and the colours are pretty accurate. It's quite sharp and and has enough brightness for outdoor visibility.  \n-> Recently working on Naught 7.0 and to the Oreo 8.0 is on the way,  \nCONS:  \n->With dual SIM only one slot acts as 4G and the other reverts to 2G only.  \n->The back has a faint and wierd creeking sound but it can be easily fixed by using a case, so not a major issue.  \n->The speaker output has decent loudness but the quality is not up to the mark.  \n->No Equaliser settings are present in the phone.  \n->No Gorilla Glass protection.  \n  \nI would advise everyone to put case on the phone as it helps in protecting the\ncamera lens and the edges are slightly raised and screen is also protected.\n\n", "Everything about this smartphone is good but you cannot use two Sims and\nmemory card simultaneously  \n  \nBut this problem is fixed when you have OTG cable and pendrive.

I'm attached some\nphotos to show the camera quality n battery backup is also great... Thanx\n\n", "Excellent budget phone just as advertised and in fact more. Astounding battery\nconsumption optimization, thanks to the EMUI. Performance is good but the\nmetal body causes makes it hot fast... Maybe that will affect the chipset life\nin the long run. Though build quality is good, durability is down the drain -\nno Gorilla glass, no support of metal body to phone giving no structural\nsupport. Charging takes a while but is compensated by battery life. Cameras\nare beyond excellence. Overall its a good product with bad durability. If you\nwant to go for it, you have to spend a little more on tempered glass and\nprotective cover if you want it to stay all nice and fast even after a few\ndrops.\n\n", "Best Camera and rest all is better than most phones in the market although a\nlittle improvement in battery go for it without any hesitation!!Although i\nwould prefer Redmi Note 4 over Honor 6x it is tough competitor...\n\n", "Amazing product- totally happy. Great camera.. one of the most affordable dual\ncameras when I bought.. Now you've more options in this price range. Detailed\nreview on my blog. Limitations- either 2 SIM Cards or 1 SIM and 1 memory.\nCan't have 2 SIM card + memory card. The non removable battery and having to\ncarry that pin is not very convenient. Otherwise overall very good phone.\n\n", "I love honor so so so much.. Honor is my love. I m a hardcore fan of Huawei\nand honor. I purchased honor holy and then I was amazed with its speciality.\nThen I unfortunately bought redmi Note4 in between but disappointed with its\nusage. Then opted this mobile which is honor 6x. It fulfilled all my\nexpectations and beyond my expectations too. It has great things which other\nmobiles dont have. It does things which latest mobiles fails to do. Even\nthough I have dropped it several times it didnt break. I dropped my phone from\na running bus, trust me Still worked awesome and no scratch too. It has so\nmany specifications really u will enjoy when u use it. Camera is good. It has\nmany options too. U can also have running video at the top to watch and use ur\nmobile simultaneously. It never hangs even if u use more than half space of\ninternal memory. Redmi mobiles and Samsungs hangs a lot. This phone doesnt\nheat up too. It has WiFi and wifi bridge too and another coolest option is\nwhen u shake ur mobile the wallpaper display will change automatically and it\nalso contains voice command calls too which means it detects ur voice and\ncalls that particular person. U can also change the color of the display And\nits size too. This mobile gives so many inbuilt applications to enjoy such as\nmirror, campus,health check and all UC apps. If u buy this mobile u will\nsurely enjoy. What I have said is very little. There is lot more to amuse us.\nThanks for those who read this.I have also attached few pictures which I room\nfrom this honor 6x mobile.\n\n", "Super mobile .. But note some drawbacks if it is ok..

Sound output and its quality via the main loud speaker is just\naverage (if the volume is set below 60%), at higher volume it is the worst I\nhave ever heard. The sound output quality via earphones is good but the max\nvolume is quite low (It's like 70% of Redmi 4/5A)  \n  \n2\\.
