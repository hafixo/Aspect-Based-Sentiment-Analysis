It's not at all camera phone.\nBuy 32 GB variant of Honor 6X. 64 GB is overpriced. Better you buy Honor 9i by\nspending 2K more for good selfie.\n\n", "\\---------------------  \nMY VERDICT  \n\\---------------------  \n\u25cf What's great in this device?  \n  \n1\\. The dual camera setup on the back can take some nice portrait shots.  \n2\\. The build is premium and the black or the blue color device looks\nstunning.  \n3\\. The full view display on the front looks beautiful.  \n4\\. Kirin 659 Processor with 4GB RAM can handle multitasking and games with\nease.  \n5\\. Camera app comes with absolutely all beast modes.  \n  \n\u25cf What's bad in this device?  \n  \n1\\. The most important thing they missed is the fast charging that was\nabsolutely a head down stuff for me, because everyone wants it badly these\nday, or the charger provided is 3A nor the phone supports fast charging.\n(STRAIGHT AWAY A STAR LESS)  \n2\\. Hybrid sim slot is there which is something we do not like because you\ncannot use 2 sim cards with a MicroSD. (THIS POINT IS FAIRLY ACCEPTABLE TO\nSOME).  \n  \nTalking about buying this phone, yes definitely you can buy this phone if you\nlike to have best the camera stuff, performance stuff, design, etc in such a\nbudget range. Only thing you need to compromise is the fast charging. Dont get\nme wrong the battery is good and lasts a day with normal usage with almost\ncompletely charged.  \n  \nHope I was helpful to you. Thankyou.\n\n", "Loving this phone so far.....  \nPROS-  \n1.The first and most amazing usp of this mobile is its looks - bezel less\ndisplay. Its big and even handy. Well finished curbed body makes it best\nlooking smartphone under 15k.  \n2.finger print sensor is very responsive. And unlocking ur apps with ur\nfingerprint is more convenient than the password.  \n3.camera of this mobile is good actually, there are better camera phones out\nthere but in this price i say you will be more then happy with its camera\nactually. But bokhey effect is not good on this set.. But in simple mode you\nactually get good photos.  \n4.Ram now days are very important on a smartphone, so honor 7x comes with 4gb\nram. In which only about 2.85 ram is available for oprating apps rest is\noccupied for OS operations and basic applications. that is good i would say.  \n5.you won't find any heating issue with honor 7x, yes you do get some heating\nwhen playing some heavy games. But with time it doesn't heat further. So good\nmarks for head management.  \n6.the grip of this mobile is good, this holds good grip and doesn't slip from\nur hands so for a big phone like this you must have a good body surface to\nhold, so full marks for the grip.  \n7\\. My this point may seems silly but i like they are providing a transparent\ngood looking cover in box. When i bought my oneplus 5, it dropped on day one\nand got a dent on the body. So it is good that you get ur protection from the\nstart. And this cover is very good looking so the slimmer body, curvey design\nand display looks unchanged after applying the cover.  \n.  \nCONS-  \n1.you get about 6 inchs of display on honor 7x, although this phone is smaller\nthan other 5.5 inches mobiles, but still big to operate by one hand. I would\nhv given better marks if this was a 5.5 inch display in much better handy\nsize.  \n2\\. It lacks some of the newer technologies like NFC which is usefull for\nmaking payments and for easy tasks, and for connectivity. But not a problem\nfor most users.  \n3\\. Honor 7x comes with a 3340 mAh of battery, which is ok kind of capacity.\nBut what makes it a bit a downside is its non-fast charging capability. If it\nhad the fast charging feature then the battery size was not a big issue, but\npersonally i am comfortable with it and has no problem when you optimise ur\nphone and not play long games. If u are buying to play lobg games then u hv to\ncharge it very soon.  \n4\\. It comes with usb 3.0 not with c type, which will be more usable port in\nfuture.  \n.  \nConclusion -  \nI am happy with this mobile. In 13k you get a good smart phone. Specially with\na amazingly rich looks.  \nWithout its bezelless display I would hv given 4 stars but for display i am\ngiving a 5 star.\n\n", "OK.. the real auhtentic rating is here guys.  \nLooking for a phone that looks and feel great in budget .. your search is over\nwith this Honor piece.  \nBeen using it now for a week and there is absolutely no lag. The multitasking\nmay sometimes looks a bit slow (just a tiny miny bit) but otherwise great\nprocesaor.  \nI played Asphalt 8 for more than three hours straight and no heating problem .  \nBattery is good and takes around 2.5 hours to reach 100 from 0 with more than\na day of back up for moderate use.  \nUI is simply WoW!!  \nHand down for the unibody build. And 2.5d curve glass, just makes the phone\nlooks more expensive than its actual price.  \nCamera is pretty good in every section and takes crisp pics in both day light\nand low light. Few sample are attached for reference.  \nThe overall build of phone makes it pretty easy to handle single handedly.  \nFinger print sensor works like a wonder and very responsive.  \nP.S. you definitely need to order a body cover & tampered glass with this\nphone.  \nNegatives - No turbo charging option & hybrid slim slot making it difficult to\neither choose two sim or one sim and a memory card.\n\n", "Product is hanging and not work properly as per honor commitment\n\n", "I have used 5S, 6S and was planning to buy 7S but changed my mind to go with\nHonor 7x when saw a sale starting in 15 mins..  \nBelieve me its a best decision.  \nIt gives you a feel of high end mobile phone of over 50k when you hold it in\nyour hand.  \nWhile using it from last 5 days.. No lagging no problem till now.  \nI am a freelancer and i use many apps like 40-50  \nAnd the battry back up its giving me is simply amazing.  \nThe screen is very large for the single hand use but when you use it.. Its\ntotally worth it..  \nSo many functions and themes i can use.. Small small features which are very\nuseful makes it a perfect phone for me..  \n  \nWas worried when ordered that it might look like a crap chinese phone which i\nwill be ashamed of while using in front of my friends.. But i show off with\nit.. Thats what the quality is.  \n  \nThanks to amazon for 1 day delivery..  \nEverything was sealed properly.  \nBut it should have some more protection from falling or mishandling.. Thats\nwhat the only complaint is.  \nPS the touch sensor on the back.. Wow.. Unlocks the phone in a blink.. And due\nto which i was able to set multiple passwords on whatsapp and other apps too\nbecause there is no hazzle in opening the apps quickly.. Just a firm touch and\nthere you go. :)\n\n", "it's better you have to buy Nokia 1100 i.e. basic phone coz if u are facing\nproblem on network then every features is useless. we are buying phone with\nfull features but the phone have network problem then its useless. i am facing\nnetwork problem in maximum call . while dialing a number from Honor 7x it's\nshowing dialling after that phone call is disconnect. the same i call from\nlandline or another mobile phone call is connected. its not a single time. i\nhave try to cross the network problem is coming only from my phone or its real\nproblem. but always found the problem is in my phone. don't buy if u r buy\nthis phone for phone calls. else u r buying for camera or speed then its ok.\n\n", "Good mobile under 20k, nice display slim peace, bought for 11700/-\n\n", "Honor 7X Review and Pros Cons:  \nHoHonor 7X is the successor to the Honor 6X which was first dual camera phone\nin mid range. Honor 6X sales were good because of the fact that it was one of\nthe first dual camera phones in this range plus the overall performance of the\ndevice was good as well. Huawei would like to replicate the success with Honor\n7X.  \n  \nHonor 7X is actually a lot like Honor 9i which was launched recently in India.\nThe internals are same with the same chipset, same RAM. The camera setup at\nthe back is same. The display is also same. Only things that have changed from\n9i to 7X is that front camera on 7X is a single 8MP sensor while it was a dual\ncamera setup on 9i and the camera placement on the back has changed. In Honor\n9i the dual camera setup is placed vertically in the middle and on Honor 7X\nthe dual camera setup is placed horizontally on the top corner of the device.\nBecause a lot of things are similar, the review is also similar. You can take\na look at Honor 9i review here.  \n  \nHonor 7X has a metal unibody design with a 2.5D glass covering the display on\nthe front which is 5.93-inch display with Full HD Plus resolution. The aspect\nratio of the display is 18:9 which we are seeing a lot in latest phones and\ntrend is expected to continue for next few years. In a couple of years, all\nphones might come with these full view 18:9 displays.  \n  \nThe hardware inside the Honor 7X is decent as well. We have a Kirin 559 SOC\nwhich is an octa-core chipset with 2 clusters of 4 A53 cores. One cluster is\npower efficient and runs at a lower frequency. The other cluster runs at\nhigher frequencies and is able to handle heavy workloads like heavy games and\napps. For storage we have 3 variants: 32GB, 64GB and 128GB. There is a hybrid\nsim slot as well which can be used to increase the storage by up to 256GB. We\ndo not like the concept of hybrid sim slot but companies are still going for.\nWe hope it changes in future.  \n  \nIn the camera department, we have a dual camera setup on the back. There is a\n16MP+2MP dual camera setup. The higher resolution sensor is a color sensor and\nlower resolution is a black and white sensor. Details from both sensors are\ncombined to improve image quality. It also helps in giving a depth/bokeh\neffect to your pictures which are also known as portrait shots. In the camera\napp, you can actually change the object that you want in focus which is quite\nuseful sometimes. The camera performance is good for a device in this range.\nThe Mi A1 back camera is slightly better than this but it does not have a\nlarge 5.9 bezel-less display. On the front, there is a single 8MP camera which\nis capable of taking some nice detailed shots in daylight. The camera\nperformance is decent. The front camera on Honor 9i is better because it has a\ndual camera setup on the front as well. So selfie lovers should go for Honor\n9i.\n\n", "Amazing mobile, I love it, for look..18:9 looks fabulous... Touch I very\nresponsive and smooth 5star, performance 5star, music system superb....

I'll break down the pros and cons of this phone:  \n  \n1\\. Look 9/10 Good luck getting a better looking phone under 15k.  \n  \n2\\. Camera 8/10. Not perfect but the images are so good. Even low light shots\naren't bad. The front camera is fine and primary camera is very good. If\ncamera is a high priority for you and budget is under 15k, go for this phone.  \n  \n3\\. Gaming performance 8/10. Haven't experienced any lagging despite playing\nLast Day on Earth regularly and having many other apps running at the same\ntime. Injustice Gods also worked well.  \n  \n4\\. Battery 7.5/10. Didn't expect battery to last very long when I got this as\nsome reviews said it didn't last long with gaming. It did last me longer than\nexpected. Very decent actually. And it charges quicker than other non fast\ncharging phones I have used.  \n  \nCons:  \n  \n1\\. Heating 6/10. But this is honestly expected if you play games regularly on\nyour phone. Nothing unusual and it's not like it heats up too quickly or makes\nthe phone too hot to touch. You can still continue with your phone activities\nwithout any issues. Yet it would be good if it can be reduced.  \n  \nI don't have more cons to add at this point because I am honestly very\nsatisfied with Honor 7x phone. It's a great phone for its price. If you are\nconsidering this phone, as someone who has used it for over one month, I say\ngo for it.\n\n", "Water bubbles on screen\n\n", "The Honor 7X is the newest smartphone to sport an 18:9 aspect ratio screen,\nand has been launched at a starting price of Rs. 12,999. It is the successor\nto the Honor 6X (Review) and comes shortly after the launch of the Honor 9i\n(Review),  \nOne look at the spec sheet and it is evident that Honor has loaded this phone\nup with loads of features, but is that enough to give it an edge in this\ncompetitive price segment? We'll answer that question and more in our Honor 7X\nreview.  \nWe like smartphones with big displays, and the Honor 7X ticks this box. The\nfront is dominated by a 5.93-inch screen with thin borders on the sides but\ncomparatively thicker ones at the top and bottom.

A lot of pre loaded\nmodes are provided.  \n  \nSummarizing  \nIf you want a really nice looking, cool and genuine all rounder, with some\nnicks of improvements, this is for you.\n\n", "it is such a nice phone friends , some important info for up coming buyers :  \n  \nHeating issue : yes heats , but only after usage of camera image / video , (\nnote : some people may get heating issue on 1st usage itself , it continuous\nfor 2 - 3 days , later it stops , its a common issue on few mobiles.  \nimage / Video Quality : its okk , suitable for youtubers , ohh yeah in video\nwe will get pause option , in order to change the angles , rather than\ncontinue shoots , about image , wide angle images are really fits your screen\nwith clear details.  \nBuilt Quality : its superb , no more comments.  \nVoice Quality : On normal talking itself the voice is really very loud , we\nhave to decrease the volume levels , when there is any personal calls.  \nMobile Color Choice : Till now i always use black color mobiles , but this\ntime i tried with white one , OMG its really eye catching on crowd.  \nItems in the box : mobile , charger , transparent case ( very bulk ) ,\nwarranty card , sim tool.  \n  \nBTW friends i personally bought nillkin back cover case for my honer 7x , its\nreally good and best product , here the attachments , even i shooted video in\nyoutube , to watch friends you just type ( vamsi naik honor 7x ).\n\n", "DAY 4 UPDATES  \n\\---------------------  \nI have mixed feelings (still positive though) about this phone knowing fully\nwell that it's not a flagship phone and expectations should be toned down\naccordingly. Here are a few more updates  \n  \n\\- Battery life: have uploaded three more pictures that show the Screen On\nTime (it's amount of time screen was on and in use with battery starting at\n100% and discharging to almost 0%). In my case, the battery discharged to 5%\nand the SOT was 4 hr 13 mins approx. This is not bad but it's not good either\ngiven the battery capacity. This is running the screen at 50% brightness, not\nrunning power saving mode and using the phone to play a couple of heavy games,\nwatching youtube video, browsing and then some social media (all in all that's\ntypical of an average user)  \n  \n\\- Performance: This is also mixed. I played Asphault 8 for about 10 minutes.\nThe battery drained faster which is expected but the phone also became hot\n(backside upper part). Without the case, it felt hotter. The performance after\nthis was not good at all, perhaps because the processor was throttled due to\nit being hot. Without playing games, the phone performs good but after playing\na heavy game, it didn't perform well - apps took longer time to open and there\nwas stutter in scrolling too  \n  \n\\- Bluetooth: it was easy to connect to any bluetooth enabled device once the\nphone had bluetooth on so it's all good here. However the issue was trying to\nswitch on bluetooth from the pulldown menu. At least in my unit, it didn't\nwork though I tried multiple times. Maybe it's a software defect. Will keep on\ntrying.  \n  \n\\- Selfie Camera: this can be easily put in good category. The selfie camera\nto me at least pulled in better pictures than my iPhone 7 plus in day time and\nin dim light past evening. That's a major plus so happy with that.  \n  \n\\- Sound quality through headphone jack: it was good, infact very good. I\ntried the AKG earphones that came with Galaxy Note 8 and the sound quality was\nat par with Note 8. So happy with it  \n  \nI'll certainly lower the rating from 4.5 to 4 with the processor throttling\nand bluetooth switch on issue. Otherwise the experience has been good so far.  \n  \nDAY 1 UPDATES  \n\\---------------------  \nI have always had flagship phones but was looking for a backup phone and\nthought that this would be a good candidate. I received this phone today so\nposting this review based on my initial impression of it. Will keep it very\nsimple - what's in the box, what's there to like about this phone, what's not\nso good about the phone  \n  \nWHAT'S IN THE BOX  \n\\- Phone with 5.93 inch display, IPS LCD panel  \n\\- Charging brick and micro-USB cable  \n\\- A TPU transparent case  \n\\- SIM ejector tool  \nNote: like other Huawei phones, was expecting that this phone will have a pre-\ninstalled screen protector but there isn't one  \n  \nWHAT'S THERE TO LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE  \n\\- Build Quality: it's excellent to say the least. Holding this you can't say\nthat this is a $200 phone. It has a premium solid feel with no flex. Metal on\nthe back and gorilla glass on the front  \n\\- Looks: the phone looks good with aluminium back that is blue (check out the\npictures). From the front too, it looks and feels modern and follows the\ncurrent trend of 18:9 aspect ratio.  \n\\- Fingerprint sensor: It's lightening fast and has always worked up until\nnow. So overall very good  \n\\- 3.5 mm audio jack: it's there. Putting this in the things to like section\nbecause even the most premium and expensive phones don't have this now.\nExample, iPhone, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, Google Pixel so it's really a luxury\nnow-a-days  \n\\- Software: this can be subjective for a lot of people but I do like EMUI\nsoftware. The version is 5.1 which is not the latest but still EMUI is a good\nskin because it feels like a good mix of iPhone and Android (am a fan of iOS\nand this is a good mix)  \n\\- Call Quality: It's very good. I am using T-mobile and getting a good signal\nin my area. It's comparable to my Galaxy Note 8.  \n\\- Sound quality through bottom firing speaker: Again at this price, would\ndefinitely say that that sound quality is good. There's just one bottom firing\nspeaker but its plenty loud. Not a lot of bass but enough clarity  \n  \nWHAT'S NOT SO GOOD ABOUT THIS PHONE  \n\\- Rear Camera at night: I have taken just a few shots from this camera,\nmostly night time - a few of them indoor and a few of them outdoor. In both\ncases the images are falling apart. Indoor images have a blur so unless you\nhold the phone steady, you won't get a nice shot. Outdoor it doesn't capture\nenough light and the results are grainy photos. Will try to post some samples.  \n\\- Use of micro-USB port for charging: In this day and age of USB type C, this\nphone comes with micro-USB. No way a deal breaker though. There's no fast\ncharging but again with the price, it's ok  \n  \nA few more things:  \n\\- Battery life: Though I have used this for a short period of time, the\nbattery life at least for now appears to be good. After a couple of days, it\nwould be possible to put this in the above two categories  \n\\- Performance: This phone comes with Andoid Nougat and not the latest Oreo.\nIt's a bit slower than flagship phones maybe due to the processor being mid-\nrange. I know this phone shouldn't be compared with a flagship phone.  \n\\- Rear camera in day time: yet to be tested during the day, will try to post\nsome sample pictures  \n\\- Selfie camera: yet to be tested both in day time and night time so would\nupdate in next few days  \n\\- Sound Quality through headphone jack: would be able to update in next few\ndays  \n  \nI would have rated this 4.5 given that it's not a flagship phone but that's\nnot an option. In the end rated this as 4 because it's a bit behind in terms\nof both camera and performance\n\n", "Well product is really good  \n* Great camera both back and front  \n* Battery is little bit low should be 4000 mh would be better  \n* And available space is less I get 18 GB out of 32gb  \n* Sound quality and sound range is bit low both in earphone and handset speaker  \n* Built quality and texture is rich  \n* Big screen size full 18:9  \n* Looks like iPhone 7 with finger print sensor  \n* Finger print sensor works great  \n* Smooth touch  \n* Split screen is great to see  \n  \nOver all I like this phone and recommend to buy it . You will get everything\nin this price.\n\n", "In this era of daily updates of new phones , there is literally no end to the\nwants of people.  \nBut this one does what's expected out of it, what's needed out of it.  \n  \nReview After a month's use.  \n  \nLooks:  \nBest display and the split screen function is pretty cool. Camera is out of\nthe body so a back cover is required (which is included with this phone) to\navoid scratches.  \nLooks premium on this budget.  \n  \nTouch:  \nGreat response, but I have a very rugged use so I always use tempered glass or\nany screen guard. A little rough in comparison to using without any screen\nguard, but this is a sacrifice I am willing to give.  \n  \nBattery:  \nA day with data on for whole day, some Netflix , some YouTube, games and\ncalls, roughly used 60-70% of battery, so I am pretty satisfied with it.  \n  \nCamera:  \nIf you look at the budget, it's like jack of all and king of none. It gives a\ntaste of every function that a high end phone have, but as you can guess\nquality of those functions are not that great.  \nNormal photography is decent for this phone, great actually.  \n  \nSoftware:  \nAndroid runs smoothly on this, no lags as such.  \n  \nFinal verdict: if you are looking for a high end phone with low end budget,\nthat's your deal right here.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 4 February 2018", "on 18 December 2017", "on 20 January 2018", "on 3 January 2018", "on 23 March 2018", "on 7 February 2018", "on 13 February 2018", "on 12 March 2018", "on 31 December 2017", "on 28 February 2018"], "reviewer": ["James Mangte", "Ashish", "Amazon Customer", "shivam", "\ud83d\udde3\u2582\u2583\u2584\u2585\u2586\u2587\u2588\u2593\u2592\u2591FeeDz\u2591\u2592\u2593\u2588\u2587\u2586\u2585\u2584\u2583\u2582\ud83d\udde3", "Anupam Das", "vamsi naik", "Evil Playa", "sachin ingle", "Mukesh"]},

The display and design were\nmy first priority and the honor 7x rocks these aspects. The full vision\ndisplay looks nice on these 2.5D curved displays.

Totally lag free, I haven't seen one app crashing or lagging.\nIt's a beauty and a beast in the same body.  \nCons: the stock android that a lot of people love isnt here but emui is\nbeautiful and very fast, there are Bloatware that I mentioned already but the\ncustomization on the emui is really cool. You can totally change the looks\nwithout a third party app. And the USB port is not type c. So no fast\ncharging. It takes 2 hours 10 minutes to charge from 0-100.

Battery life is\ngood, it can easily last whole day with atleast 30% charge remaining at the\nend of the day after moderate usage. By moderate I mean 2 hrs of youtube and\n3-4 hrs of net surfing and social networking. The very usp of this mobile is\nits great look although a bit heavier then samsung smartphones but look wise\nthis is awesome. Specs are also at par with other premium smartphones. Back\ncamera quality is very good. The only thing lacking is that the manufacturer\ndoesn't provided screen guard with this mobile. Also, this mobile lacks amoled\ndisplay, so if you are currently using amoled display mobile, you can easily\nnotice the change. Build quality is good and gives a sturdy metal look.  \nOn a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best, I will rate this mobile as-  \nLooks- 10  \nPerformance-9  \nBuild quality-8  \nValue for money-8  \nCamera-9  \nBattery life-6  \nSpeaker quality-6\n\n", "I am NOT an IT geek, and this is one of the best android phones I have owned\nso far.  \n  \nYes this is a mid range phone, but it has everything you could want from a\nsmart phone in 2017. I stopped buying the ultra premium/top of the line\nhandsets a few years ago as phones in this range provide the most value for\nyour money with relatively little compromises:  \n  \nBuild quality ----- Sleek metal body design ( but like most people I keep it\nin a cover)  \n  \nGreat battery life ----- This phone has a large battery ( 3340mAh ), and the\nsoftware tweaks like notifying you when a background app is consuming battery\nare very handy- I'm a light user and the battery lasts for a day and a half\nfor me, with moderate use a whole day should be fine  \n  \nGreat Screen ----- Works fine indoors and outdoors. You won't be able to tell\nthe difference from a top of the line phone like iPhone or Galaxy S Series\nphone unless you put the two phones side by side  \n  \nDecent Camera ----- with HD Video Recording. It will be unfair to compare it\nto iPhone/Galaxy S Series cameras. This In terms of the picture quality, I'd\ngive it a 6.5 to 7 out of 10- It has a flash but night/low light photos are\njust \"meh\"  \n  \nFast , Responsive CPU and more than enough RAM  \n  \nFor gaming - I've tried games like 'Bart' a full 3D game and it handled it\nfine. Although in fairness I'm not much of a gamer but this \"should\" play most\n3D games available on play store given its specs.  \n  \nAn accurate fingerprint reader ( supports registering multiple fingers to\nunlock the phone)  \n  \nGPS works great with google maps, speedometer, compass, etc  \n  \nAnd the standard smartphone features ( Bluetooth, WiFi,NFC, Google Play)  \n  \nWi-Fi Bridge feature connect up to 4 other devices and share the available Wi-\nFi among your friends.  \n  \nOne-key Split Screen function offers an even faster multi-management\nexperience.  \n  \nAnd this phone is by a TRUSTED brand - Huawei built Nexus with Google and that\nwas extremely important for me because I definitely don't want to be putting\nmy banking apps on some unknown Chinese brand phone where who knows what is\nbeing logged. All my banking apps work without complaining.  \n  \nAll in all, this is a great phone for the price.\n\n", "I got an OTA update a day after the delivery. After the update, YouTube issue\nwas rectified and the phone got gyroscope sensor.  \nDefinitely better than both honor 9 lite and 9i.  \n  \nFirstly, 7x has Gorilla glass protection which both 9 lite and 9i do not have.\nPS: Gorilla glass provides better protection for the screen againt accidental\ndrops.  \n  \nVS 9 lite: Better rear cam (The white balance of 9 lite's captures is very bad\nand lacks details). 7x has got Larger screen, Better memory management, and\nSlightly better battery backup. Moreover, 9 lite's glass back is fragile. A\nsingle drop can shatter the back glass. Only advantages of 9 lite is its front\ncam and android version. PS: 7x's front cam is also decent enough and will get\nOreo update very soon.  \n  \nVS 9i: I don't think 9i got gyroscope in the latest udpate like 7x. All\nfeatures are same compared to 7x except for front cam and portrait mode of\nrear cam. 9i's photos (both rear and front) are slightly over saturated which\nsome like and some don't. It's upto you. The side bezels of 9i is slightly\nsmaller than 7x's. Not noticible easily though.

Intensive use will necessitate a charge by the end of the day.There\nare various power saving features on offer in EMUI 5.1 such as a mode which\nlowers the screen resolution as required in order to save battery life.  \nDual Back (16MP+2MP secondary - the sole job of which is to capture depth\ndata)Camera images taken outdoors and in well light conditions are  \nV.good with good detail and sharpness, quality suffers in low light, autofocus\nis fast, fully featured Pro mode, with the ISO, exposure, shutter speed and so\non, Bokeh shots look decent and are better than those produced by some\ncompetitors. 8MP front camera produces images with adequate detail and is\ngood, biggest issue with the front camera is the bokeh mode, bokeh shots are\nproduced via software algorithms.  \nMy verdict:It has a sleek and classy bezel-less design, solid build quality, a\npunchy and vibrant display and fairly good battery life must buy at this price\npoint i.e 12999/- If you can live with bezels and dont want sleek and classy\ndesign and can spend more money than you can go with Xiaomi Mi A1 and Moto G5S\nPlus\n\n", "Worst camera ever seen..front camera OK...  \nStylish look..Rear camera is just worst..many bugs in image processing..no\nsharp edges...gets blend near edges..\n\n", "I bought this mobile 1 week before bt till now it does not connect to 4G\nconnect oly 3G\n\n", "Honest review after using for 5 days  \n  \nFirst of all excellent delivery of amazon!!!

If honor\ngives regular updates like these I don't think there would be any reason to go\nfor devices like mi a1.  \n  \nCons  \n  \nI don't see that much cons in my daily usage, only thing I miss infrared\nblaster and lack of NFC.  \n  \nFirst charging is not a matter as almost in 2 hours this phone can give enough\njuice to run a full day.  \n  \nGo for it you will never regret your decision,  \nBefore buying this phone heard about screen flickering issue all things are\nrumours!!\n\n", "Mobile look cameras & display was excellent.

Rear Camera- 16+2 MP Not very Awsome but does decent work when you use\nPortrait mode, wide angle and normal.

Hats off to honor for choosing metal\nover plastic body  \n4.Dual rear facing cameras for Bokeh effect works perfectly fine  \n5.Phone handles multi tasking with eaze with its kirin 659 processor.  \n6.Once again hats off to honor for not skipping on sensors .  \n7\\. 3340mah Battey doesn't dsappoint you.It can easily last for an day with\nnormal usage.  \n8.Presence of headphone jack in 2017.(thumbs up for that ).  \n9.Presence of MicroSd Slot (Its worth mentioning.Spending extra 3k for 32gb\nnot a great choice).  \n10.Thanks to honor for providing free transparent silicon cover with\npackaging(though not of great quality anyway it is so kind of you )  \n  \nCons:  \n1.Speaker is not too loud and even sometimes sounds bit low.  \n2.Its December 2017,But still honor decided to go for Micro USB port thats\nreally disappointing.  \n3.Auto brightness sensor doesn't perform upto its limit.Display is almost\ninvisible under sunlight.  \n4.This phone takes too long to charge.Even with the specified 5V 2A charger.  \n5.Under low light both the camera doesnt perform upto our expectation.  \n6.Phone heats up a bit while charging(Anyway considering its metal built this\ncan be ignored).  \n7.Memory management is poor with EMUI 5.1.Out of 4gb of ram you can expect\naround 2.15gb of usable ram.  \n8.Offcourse you can expect lots of bloatwares with this device(Anyway most of\nthem can be uninstalled)  \n8.Front facing camera is not good for selfies.(Becomes almost dark even under\nhomelighting).  \n9.Though phone as 18:9 Aspect ratio .Their are not many contents available on\ninternet which supports this aspect ratio(Especially i hate those black bars\non sides while watching most of the youtube videos.)  \n  \nVerdict:  \nThis is one of the best choice for people who loves using full hd\ndisplay.,loves watching movies and playing mid level games etc.But,if you are\npersonal who loves photography(professional) and playing high end games sorry\nthen this one is not for you\n\n", "Undoubtedly, honor brand is known for  \n\\- Thin metal body, slim yet solid.  \n\\- Customized U.I. which provides great ease to use, completely user friendly.  \n\\- Last but not the least, every new device brings the best camera for the\nprice range.  \n  \nHave used the device for quite a while, here are my reviews:  \n  \nPROs:  \n\\- Metal body shroud along with slim dimensions, gives an absolute premium\nfeel on holding it.  \n\\- Blue color variant is the best colorin the market, design of the device\nalong with this color gives a great premium feel which is completely unique,\ncan be compared with iPhone here.  \n\\- As always a customized U.I. makes things easy and fluid to navigate and do\nthe tasks on it.  \n\\- Combination of Kirin processor and 4gb ram only asks the user to challenge\nit with more tasks, yet still never it lags. Gaming and multitasking is\nsmooth.  \n  \nAlso you get 4-5 games in the device with the trial version.  \n  \n\\- You get a CASE COVER out of the box for free, yes you have read it right,\nit provides a case cover which is completely transparent and decent enough to\nprotect the device.  \n  \n\\- Bigger display just indulges you into it with 18:9 ration and bezel-less\ndisplay is a great experience.  \n  \n\\- Honor devices are icons for smartphone photography, yet again it proves the\nsame here, with an updated feature for moving objects and improved camera, it\nbeats its predecessor.  \n  \nAll in all a great smartphone with the best camera within the range and a\nunique premium feel not to miss at all.  \n  \nCONs:  \n\\- Being an updated model to honor 6x, its camera gets 16+2MP from 12+2MP,\nincrease in size and 18:9 view, no other changes to it.  \n\\- Having released Honor 9i previously, one could only enter a dilemma, which\none to go for, also 7x and 9i are almost same, except for 7x with only a\nsingle lens on the front instead of a dual, but increase in size. If you are\nselfie addict, plz go for 9i and not 7x, bcoz 9i comes with dual selfie camers\nbut 7x does not.  \n\\- Price for 64gb variant is comparatively too high, compared to 32gb one\nwhich costs 3k less, difference of 3k for 32gb is too much...  \n  \nLet me know if the review was helpful..\n\n", "\n\n\u00a0Honor 7X is the latest entrant in dual camera phones and it has come with a\nbang. 18:9 ratio full screen Full HD+ display makes it stand apart in the\ncompetition. The dual rear camera is the best in class as per the price\nsegment. The Kirin 659 CPU is pretty fast and has no lag whatsoever. 4 GB RAM\nalso keeps things running smooth. Exceptional feautures like support for\nfinegerprint gestures and native screen recording is welcome. Battery life is\ndecent for a day with moderate use. Front 8MP camera also supports bokeh and\nbeauty mode. SAR value is 1.23. Screen size is 5.93 inch. Value for money at\n\u20b912999 or the 4GB/32GB model.

However, it is bigger in size and can be\na bit unmanageable with one hand  \n\ud83d\udd34Thanks for reading Guys!. If you have any question or if you think I am\nwrong.

Below, I have captured\nsome basic observations about Honor 7x (+ positive, - negative, ~general)\nbased on my usage experience:  \n\\+ performance is excellent, didn't noticed any lags so far while using\nregular apps (news, trading apps, surfing, and basic games). It has octa-core\nHiSilicon Kirin 659 processor (4 x 2.36GHz Cortex-A53 cores + 4 x 1.7GHz\nCortex-A53 cores) + 4 GB RAM which makes it fly!  \n\\+ display is crisp and clear, color looks good. The 5.93 inch screen with a\nresolution of 1080x2160 pixels is excellent. It sports the new 18:9 aspect\nratio which is super cool!  \n\\+ touch is smooth, performance and multitasking is impressive.  \n\\+ looks are premium and build quality is excellent, it is sleek, light weight\nand good to hold.  \n\\+ camera is just above average. It has a 16MP + 2MP dual back camera and 8MP\nfront facing camera (no front flash, so average selfies), though you it has\nthe blur functionality. I have posted a large number of photos with default\ncamera settings. You can judge yourself how they are.  \n\\+ call quality is good, and the signal reception is decent.  \n\\+ a back cover is provided, which is good. It will provide you sufficient\nsupport till a decent cover is available in retail.  \n\\+ fingerprint scanner is quick, responsive and precise, and the placement is\nsuperb.  \n\\+ wi-fi and blue-tooth connectivity are at par.  \n\\+ no heating issues noticed while charging or regular usage, with extended\nusage you can slightly feel the bare back gets little warm, but can't feel\nanything with the cover on.  \n\\+ this 32 GB variant has a usable free space of ~ 20 GB.  \n\\- on the flip side, only single speaker and it sounds very average.  \n\\- the charging time is relatively slower.  \n\\- the OS, that is android v7.0 Nougat with EMUI 5.1 skin looks outdated\ncompared against others.  \n\\- no earphones provided! Nobody uses the out-of-the-box earphones, still it\nis expected to be provided in the package.  \n\\- no native video calling option available in the device which can leverage\nVoLTE. Though third party apps can be used for making video calls over\ninternet.  \n~ after initial boot, got a patch update of size 448 MB, which I believe are\nstability bug fixes.  \n~ I haven't faced the screen flicker issue yet while playing YouTube, but as\nmany are complaining about it, this definitely must be there and should be\naddressed. One thing I can tell, it must be a software issue which can be\nfixed with a patch release, so nothing to worry much hopefully.  \n  \nIMHO, considering things holistically, H7X is not far behind than its\ncompetitions. With its cool aspect ratio, sturdy build, and most importantly\nthe price of H7X 32GB variant perfectly fits for those who are on tight budget\nor want it as a secondary phone. Overall, a worthy buy, value for money phone\n- one of the better options in under 15K segment. Go for it without second\nthought keeping in mind the limitations highlighted above, definitely an\nexcellent product in its segment.  \n  \nPictures are posted for reference, I hope this helps.\n\n", "\n\n\u00a0Hello my phone is just 3 days old I am Watching youtube since 1 hour my honor\n7x phone display starts flicking.iam are unable to do anything simply you have\nto restart your phone.so don't buy this phone,I have posted a video below you\ncan see it ,I am facing this issue for third time in three days\n\n", "Note:- Always read reviews before buying anything online.

As being a\narchitecture student it is very good for me to have such a big screen. Again\nthe placement of headset,front camera and proximity sensor is very good. Touch\nis so nice that it feels like there is no screen between the content and\nfingers  \nDisplay 10/10  \n2\\. Speakers: As I have upgraded from Oneplus One to Honor 7x I feel that\nspeaker quality is not that good but at this price point it is negligible.  \nSpeakers: 8/10  \n3\\. Rear camera: Front camera is really best in comparison with the mobiles\nunder 20k. Bokeh effect would have been better  \nRear camera: 9/10  \n4\\. Front Camera: It is good but not the best. Front camera in this price\nrange is best in Oppo F5 (obviously it's selfie expert)  \nFront camera:7/10  \n5\\. Battery: Battery backup is really very good...after all its Huawei...best\nknown for its battery. Battery easily lasts for a day with\nvideos,surfing,chatting and calls  \nBattery:10/10  \n6\\. Battery charging time: Only this is Con of this mobile. It takes around\n3hr to charge. But once it gets charged...no worries  \nBattery charging time: 2/10  \n7.Performance: Performance is really good. It doesn't lags between switching\napps. Haven't tried heavy games but they might work properly.  \nPerformance:9/10  \nFingerprint sensor: It is just very accurate. Doesn't miss even a single time.\nVery fast.  \nFingerprint sensor:10/10  \n  \nSome cool features:  \n1) Screen in screen: This feature allows us to watch video in other screen\nthat is while using other apps  \n2) Split screen: Though it is a feature of Android Noughat...it is plus point\nin this device because of its FullView display  \n3) Fingerprint sensor: It can be used to pull down navigation bar, browse\nphotos, receive calls, stop alarm and take photos.  \n4) Ultra battery mode: One of the awesome feature. Just start this mode when\nmobile is not in use. It will drastically increase the battery life.  \n5)Scroll Screenshot: One of the cool feature. Reduces task of taking repeated\nscreenshots  \n6) Screen Video: Good to see this. Other Android devices need to be rooted for\nthis but it is inbuilt here.  \n7) EMUI: Very good. Interesting and easy to use.  \n8)Themes: Lots of themes available in the store.  \n  \nAnd also there is a silicon cover inside the box  \nThat's all.  \nThe smartphone is really very good. Just go for it.\n\n", "\n\n\u00a0Overall mobile is good but i have a problem with YouTube\n\n", "What I observed about us Indians that we only believe what we heard most of\nthe time. Likewise, how we Indians were reluctant on buying Mi phones and\nOneplus when it was launched people used to laugh at me when I bought phones\nfrom that companies.  \nNow people are doing the same when I bought my first honor device past week.  \nAbout Huawei company  \n1\\. It spent a whopping $11.7 Billion on R&D in 2016 alone.  \n2\\. It was one of the first company to pioneer dual camera technology (of\ncourse after HTC and LG) but at least before So-called Apple.  \n3\\. It is the first company to launch AI enabled processor.  \n4\\. It became the biggest telecom equipment manufacturer on the planet.  \n  \nI think that speaks a lot about the company now coming to the phone itself.  \n  \n1\\. The screen on this phone is the charm, believe me, it's an IPS display not\nOLED or AMOLED but colour saturation and sharpness are good enough or better\nthan most of its competition.  \n2\\. The phone handles day to day task pretty well and I don't see any lags\nwhatsoever.  \n3\\. UI is a bit dated but smooth and working as expected, as I am the fan of\nstock android tough.  \n4\\. No heating issue at all.  \n5\\. The camera is pretty decent in this price range and comes with loads of\nfeatures. and believe me this phone is insanely a looker.  \n  \nComing to the screen flickering issue and Company is acknowledging the issue\nand working on fixing it and on Andriod Oreo update. I will post the mail\nscreenshot. It's overall 4.5 \u2b50 from my side.\n\n", "\n\n\u00a0After i received the product from day one onwards i am facing serious display\nflickering issues mainly while watching YouTube and then it restarts and hangs\nfrequently. Also this product is having serious battery draining issues. I\nwould recommend don't purchase this product also please don't trust the\ncustomer care executive they are just trying to fool us. They won't solve the\nproblem rather they will make illogical excuses.\n\n", "Changed my review after update. Guys, trust me, this is one of best mobile\ntill now under 16k. Most liked after update.  \nNice display amd camera is upto the mark. No issues with youtube or volte.\nPlaying games online and battery backup is improved.  \nSound is far much batter now. I was about to sell this mobile but now i wont.\nI got everything i needed. Its an awesome experience.  \nHope you guys have enjoyed this beast too.\n\n", "Disclaimer-Be patient as this is a long,detailed,precise and honest review.  \n  \nI would first tell you one very important thing and that is the 'EMUI' thing\nin this phone. This has EMUI5.1 on top of the Android 7 and so those of you\ndrooling over stock Android stuff, EMUI is far better cauz it is way too fluid\nand gives you very much versatility.And if you think stock Android is faster,\nthen you wouldn't even feel a difference in the performance and you can even\ncheck that out using Benchmark scores and also some YouTube comparison videos.  \nAnd regarding the bloatware, it all is uninstallable as I myself have done\nthat and removed all the pre-installed apps except CHROME and a few other\nimportant apps.  \n  \nI am definitely loving this phone and gave it a five star as it was no tough\ndecision for me given the following points:-  \n  \n1) The processor,a Snapdragon equivalent of RedMI A1, is really damn fast as I\nran Asphalt8 and Modern Combat 5 at the same time and did not find any lag ,\nso it is pretty much craved for from a gamer's perspective.  \n2) The design of this phone, I'd say awesome cauz those curves got me drooling\nover it and that edge-to-edge display looked really very great.I never missed\nout on a chance to show it off in front of my friends.  \n3)RAM is 4gb which is pretty good and u will get blistering fast performance  \n4)EMUI 5.1 is way better than stock android and that you would get a lot many\nupdates from Honor thus keeping your phone up to date  \n5)Though battery is not very great but for carrying out moderate tasks, you\nwill easily get 12-5 hrs. For gaming intensive routine, a 6hr life is there\nwhich is not really bad but not really good either.  \n6) MISCELLANEOUS -Fingerprint sensor is lightning fast and the front camera\nhas some kind of flash (found that while clicking a selfie in the dark) thing\nfor low-light.  \n  \nNOW comes the Camera.  \nThe dual camera setup is really great.Many reviews pointed out that the camera\nperformance in low light conditions is very bad. Well I used it in low-light\nand I found it very good. Why?? Cauz I know how to use PRO PHOTO mode. Dude\nthis phone has got really good pro photo and a PRO VIDEO mode too. I have\nuploaded only low-light pics but you can see that they're good.  \n  \nYou can post your queries in the comment section.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 25 December 2017", "on 28 January 2018", "on 26 December 2017", "on 26 January 2018", "on 13 December 2017", "on 23 December 2017", "on 6 January 2018", "on 27 December 2017", "on 29 December 2017", "on 2 January 2018"], "reviewer": ["\ud83d\udd34\u0299\u029c\u1d00\u1d20\u1d07s\u029c \u0299.\u1d0f.\u1d1b\u2122\ud83d\udc7d", "alter-ego", "Pranay", "Keerthi Kanth", "Amazon Customer", "Amazon Customer", "Jabir Ansari", "supratim choudhury", "MUZIK D", "Shubh"]},

Though it\nhas 3340 mah battery due to its display quality it drains quickly it can last\nfor a day long with calls, WiFi, data and GPS on, and if you are playing games\nor watching video it lasts nearly 4 to 5 hours with full brightness  \n2)back camera portrait shots.  \n3)GPU is Mali T830 which is OK not for true gamers  \nAnd that's all guys and my final conclusion is go for it this is best phone\nyou can get it in this price range  \nHope you find this review helpful\n\n", "I own honor 6x and now 7x I don't see anything special in 7x xcept screen\nsize..

With moderate usage, 1.7GB RAM is free (average).  \n* Good processor - HiSilicon Kirin 659 Octa-core. I haven\u2019t noticed any lag till now.  \n* Good camera (for this price). There are various \u201cpro\u201d modes which let you tinker with settings as in a DSLR. The front camera is quite good.  \n* Good battery - 3340 mAh (non-removable). Easily lasts more than a day for me with moderate use.  \n* Price <13k !!  \n* Free transparent case (might be a limited-time offer). While the case is good at protecting the camera & back of the phone, it doesn\u2019t look like it will protect the screen in case of a face-down drop. This is because there is very little protrusion of the case in the front of the device.  \n  \nThe bad:  \n* No fast-charging  \n* Uses Micro-USB instead of USB-C  \n* Running Android 7.0 Nougat as of now. Oreo update is in the works apparently.  \n* No headphones included in the box  \n  \nI received an update mid-Jan which brought VoLTE settings on the phone (till\nthen, I couldn\u2019t find anything for VoLTE in settings). However, I\u2019m not sure\nif it is enabled since there is no indication on the status bar which says so.\nHowever, the android version still remains 7.0 (Nougat) even though Android\nsecurity patches are updated to 1-Jan-2018.  \n  \nThe highlight of the phone is of course the display. Very few phones have an\n18:9 \u2018FullView\u2019 display at this price range at the moment (as of Jan 2018).\nFor ex, LG Q6 also has a similar screen, but lacks fingerprint sensor.  \nHonor 7x\u2019s display looks gorgeous while in action. Also, the Blue colour\nvariant of the phone sets it apart in a market flooded with Black & Gold\ncolour options. The fingerprint sensor is quite fast in unlocking the phone.  \n  \nI bought the 32GB variant. The firmware occupies 9.6GB space. You can add upto\n256GB external memory using SIM-2 slot.  \nThe invoice which I downloaded from Amazon doesn\u2019t have the IMEI or Serial\nnumber of the phone. However, the packaging slip had it. I\u2019m not sure if this\nwould be a problem, but I\u2019m checking with GreenMobiles if they can issue me a\ninvoice with IMEI number.  \n  \nOverall, I\u2019m delighted with the phone. Till more phones with FullView displays\nhit the market at this price-point, this phone will retain an advantage over\ncompetition.\n\n", "My personal opinion after using this phone for 5 days..  \n  \n1\\. CAMERA  \nBack camera hardware is very good, struggles a bit in the low light but can be\ncompared to some of the mid rangers of Samsung and LG phones. Very satisfied\nwith normal mode on daylight shots but colour reproduction is little\ninaccurate. Looks over exposed. Bokeh effect and wide aperture mode is totally\nuseless and needs serious software improvement. (3.9/5)  \n  \nFront camera is again very good in normal lighting conditions only problem is\nover exposure. If you use in day lighting condition it looks more brighter but\nmore(more than it should be) darker in low light. Bokeh effect and portrait\nmode are very inaccurate. Bokeh effect cannot properly separate the edges of\nface and body from the background. Also while video calling in low light looks\ndarker than it should be. Again it needs serious attention to the camera\nsoftware.. (3.8/5)  \n  \n2\\. LOOK AND FEEL  \nFeels really premium on hand. Well built, perfect size, blue colour looks\nunique. Only thing I don't like in a smartphone is both volume and power\nbutton on the right side but the good thing for me in this phone is volume\nbuttons are on the upper side which doesn't mess up with my fingers. (5/5)  \n  \n3\\. DISPLAY  \nDisplays is outstanding Crystal clear and butter smooth should have been\nlittle brighter to view under the sun (4.9/5) otherwise there is no better\ndisplay in terms of quality for the price.  \n  \n4\\. UI AND PERFORMANCE  \nUI is very simple and easy. Lots of customization. Absolutely lag free (with\nsuch an amazing display as if I am touching the objects with my fingers)\nperformance. (5/5)  \n  \n5\\. NETWORK AND CALL  \nNetwork connectivity and call quality is really really superb. Found even\nlittle better than other devices like those of Samsung and LG but way way\nbetter than Xiaomi, Coolpad and Honor 6x (5/5)  \n  \n6\\. WiFi and GPS  \nWiFi coverage is really good also comes with WiFi bride is really handy. GPS\nis quick and accurate even inside the room. (4.9/5)  \n  \n6\\. Fingerprint sensors is very responsive and 100% accurate. (5/5)  \n  \n7\\. BATTERY  \nBattery is okay. Easily lasts a day with moderate use(Calling, WhatsApp,\nInternet surfing) (4.7/5)  \n  \n8\\. HEATING  \nThere is NO heating issues at all (at least in the winter season where the\natmospheric temperature is on the lower side). But it gets warm when we use\ncamera continuously for 5-10 minutes(which occurs in all smartphones\nliterally). (4.9/5)  \n  \n9\\. STORAGE AND MEMORY  \nStorage is a concern for this phone being a hybrid type memory card slot. The\nsituation becomes even worse when the system occupies 9 GB of space out of 32\nGB. There is only 19 GB (Normally 2 - 4 GB less than others) is available for\nthe user. But I don't strore lots of music or videos so its fine for me.\nTalking about 4 GB ram, I always get 2.1 to 2.4 GB of free memory despite I\nhave installed 20 heavy apps. (4.7/5)  \n  \n10\\. BLOATWARE  \nYes, bloatwares are there but the good news is that they can be removed from\nthe phone.  \n  \nI haven't tested the gaming performance yet.  \n  \nOverall I am really satisfied with the device for the price paid and knowing\nits pros and cons and being an occasional camera user for photography. Its a\ngood VFM smartphone.  \n  \nIf the seller is reading my review, please fix the camera software and\nperformance to make it a really champion smartphone.\n\n", "Description :- I'll start up with the major con of this phone that is UI, well\nit turns out to be a major pro of this phone.  \nYes EMUI experience is a flawless experience it is very snappy and cool.  \n  \nIn my opinion it provides more options than that in stock android.  \n  \nNow lets come up to the screen - well that is the highlight of the phone and\nit couldn't get any better. In my opnion it also beats the 30k price range\nphone on the market.  \n  \nPREMIUM look and feel - when you hold the phone it feels really premium and\nthe screen adds upto that premium feel of the phone.  \n  \nCAMERA - I would not say the best but it is good or average.  \nWide aperture and portrait mode are sometimes gimmicky.  \n  \nFEATURES :- the phones with stock android on the market in this price range do\nnot give us the various options to turn on same very important features\nneeded.  \n  \nDISPLAY - Couldn't get any better and the rounded edges looks just futuristic.\nThe screen very precisely blends with the body which gives an amazing grip to\nthe device.  \n  \nBATTERY - Many reviews i read\u00a0 inficated that battery backup is not good at\nall. But when i started using this device I didn't feel like battery was\ndraining very fast it gives a decent battery performance. But i would say that\ndue to type - b charging port it takes a little long time to be charged. They\nshould have used type - c port.  \n  \nConclusion :- if you want a premium feeling phone with a great display and a\nawesome UI in the budget of 13k-16k then don't think and just go for honor 7X.\n\n", "Posting this honest review after two weeks of usage:  \n  \nBattery: 8/10: Lasts a day for moderate users.  \n  \nDisplay:10/10: Beautiful full HD display.

I just connected to JIO hotspot and\nupdated it to Jan 2018 firmware package.  \nGyroscope is working fine after updates. Wifi worked without any issue.  \nNo issue with Battery as it was draining slowly.

All the downloaded softwares are\nworking fine.  \nToday I charged it for 40 minutes and it charged from 10 % to 44 % in that\nperiod.  \nAfter few seconds, display was black for 10 minutes. I tried everything but\nfailed. Mobile was on cuz I called on the number and it was ringing but\ndisplay was black. After lot of efforts to unlock, display came back with\nflickering RGB lines on Display.  \nIt worked for 10 minutes and then again I faced the same Issue. Then I tried\nthe solution that is suggested by HONOR staff.  \n1\\. Power off the phone 2. Press Volume UP button and then press Power button\nto start the phone. 3 It goes in to recovery. Wipe the CACHE PARTITION. 4.\nRestart the phone.  \nAnd now its 3 hours and its working fine without any issue. I checked all the\nfunctionality and clicked some photos, shown my phone to my office friends.\nIts working fine at least for now. Let see how it goes. I will update my\nreview later.  \n  \nUpdates: Still there is issue. Mobile is on but display is going black and\nstucks. This time I did both WIPE DATA & WIPE CACHE.  \nI will observe today and I will update if issue persists.  \n  \nFinal Words: Its good and capable phone with Best in class Display and\nfunctionality. It seems like issues are actually because of software.  \nI am not returning this phone anyway. Huawei has already sold 40 million of\nHONOR 7X devices and I hope they will support strongly for this phone.  \nThey have promised, EMUI 8.0 OREO updates in the March 2018.  \n  \nIf any question you can ask by replying to this post.\n\n", "First of oll  \n1)Packaging-worst i have ever seen  \n2)Buit and design-Go for it if have not used any smartphone with 18:9\ndisplay.I must say i looks amazing when you first hold your phone.although it\nhas 5.99 inch display it does not feel bulky. All metal build makes it much\nreliable. Better than Mi A1 or even moto g5s plus.  \n3)display-18:9 looks awesome.media consumption or even social media\nconsumption is amazing in such a tall display.  \nViewing angles was good in indoors and outdoors no complaints.toch is not\nresponsive as another phone i have used this must be because of tall display\nwhen you scroll down it scroll little bit slow as compared to any 16:9\ndisplay.  \n4)sensors-all sensors is present except gyroscope and IR blaster.If you want\nVR staffs then definitely this is not the ideal phone for you go with MI\nA1.Auto brightness sensors works very well.  \n5) speakers-It has just a single bottom firing speaker.It is now much louder\nas compared to MI A1 but it is similar to all other phones in this price\nrange.  \n3.5 mm jack- audio via 3.5 mm jack is very good no problem but MI A1 has a\ndedicated DAC which makes it a clear winner.  \n6) wireless connectivity-it only supports single wifi 2.5 Ghz band.  \nJio VOLTE works well.  \n7)sim slots-it will take two nano sims or a nano+sd card but 1st sim will hold\n4G and 2nd sim will be 2G only.  \n8)call clarity is great both with ear piece and speakers.  \n9) software-It runs on Android Nougat 7.0 with Custom skin Emui 5.1 but\ncompany has promised for Android Oreo in the first quarter of 2018.  \nIt comes preloaded with lot of bloatwares wich can be uninstallable.  \n10)Storage-go with 32 gb varient but keep in mind it provides on 19 gb of\nusable memory you definitely need a sd card.  \n11) battery-it amazing hwawei kirin 659 soc has been calibrated very\nwell.Snapdragon 625 vs kirin 659.14nm vs 16 nm.definitely kirin 659 takes the\nlead here in terms of speed as well as battery optimization.  \nIt takes 2 hrs10 mins to charge from 30-100 percent but when i have charged it\n100 percent in night and i saw on morning it was 100 percent.stand by time is\nawesome.  \n12)RAM-ram management has done very well i never kill any app from the\nbackground it manages very well.  \n13) performance-It clearly beats MI A1 in speed tests and and it is much\nsnapier than snapdragon 625 soc.  \n14)Gaming-good but sometimes it lags with high grafics settings in asphalt.No\nheating issues  \n15)CAMERA- front-8mp with beautification mode,potrait mode and much more i\nmust say if you are looking for a selfie camera then go fo it  \nCan't be compared to MI A1 it is much better than MI A1. I will provide you\nsome shots of front facing camera.  \nRear camera-16+2 mp.much better than MI A1 portrait shots is better on MI A1.\nSometimes portrait shots is like hit or miss on 7X.  \nIt has wide range shots also and moving pictures shots along with lots of\nprofessional mode options.I will provide you some shots.  \n16) videos -front camera you can shoot only 720p videos not 1080 or 4K but\nlooks very nice and surprisingly it is better than Mi A1 front camera even\nwith 1080p fottage.No video stabilization.  \nRear-1080p recording and it is similar to MI A1  \nBut not 4K.focassing it best on 7X.  \nThese are shots taken in portrait,bookeh and wide angle you decide what is\nbest for you.\n\n", "Verdict  \nFor Rs 13,000 device, the Honor 7X isn\u2019t the best.  \nIt has a great display and good battery life and the overall performance is\naverage at best.  \nIt loses out to the Mi A1 as far as the camera is concerned and graphically\nheavy games like Asphalt 8 stutter on the device.  \nYou can consider it if you aren\u2019t a heavy smartphone user and like reading\ncontent or watching movies on the go, as the display on the smartphone is\nindeed good.  \nBut if the camera is something you are finicky about and aren't a fan of\nskinned OSes,  \nthen you may want to consider your options.  \n  \nPROS  \nGreat display.  \nGood Battery Life.  \nCamera clicks good images in well lit conditions.  \n  \nCONS  \nGraphically heavy games stutter on the device.  \nUnderwhelming audio quality.  \nCompetitors have better cameras.  \n  \nHuawei Honor 7X: Detailed Review  \n  \nHonor has launched an interesting portfolio of smartphones here in 2017,\nincluding the Honor 8 Pro, Honor 9i and the Honor 6X to name some. Today we\nhave the successor to the Honor 6X, predictably called the Honor 7X.  \nThis means that it will compete with the likes of the Moto G5 Plus, Lenovo K8\nPlus, Redmi Note 4, and the current heavyweight champion of the sub 15k\ncategory, the Xiaomi Mi A1.  \nDoes it have what it takes to become the king of the hill?  \n  \nSpecifications at a glance:  \n  \nThickness: 7.6mm  \nWeight: 165 grams  \nCPU: Kirin 659 Octa-Core CPU  \nOS & UI: Android 7.1 with EMUI 5.1  \nDisplay: 5.93-inch 18:9 display  \nDisplay resolution: 2160x1080p  \nRear Camera: 16MP+2MP  \nFront camera: 8MP  \nRAM: 4GB  \nBuilt-in storage: 64GB.  \nBattery: 3340mAh  \n  \nBuild and Design  \n  \nSpeaking of the build, the Honor 7X is as premium as the Mi A1 and that isn't\na bad thing.  \nThe smartphone has a metal build with curved edges.  \nIt is ever so slightly taller than the Mi A1 and thanks to the 18:9 form\nfactor, it has thin bezels on the sides.  \nThe top and bottom bezels are quite thick and the phone has an attractive\ndesign.  \nThese bezels are thin enough that they add to the aesthetics of the smartphone\nand yet thick enough so that your palm doesn\u2019t accidentally touch the screen\nif you are trying to reach one of the top corners during single-handed use.  \nThe top and bottom bezels are thick enough to comfortably hold the phone in\nlandscape mode for watching movies and playing games.  \nAt the back, you have the fingerprint sensor conveniently located. You also\nhave the dual-camera setup which is protruding. I wish the dual camera setup\nwas as seamless as it was on the Honor 8 Pro.  \nThe right side of the smartphone has the power button and the volume rocker. T  \nhe buttons are clicky and feel good. At the bottom, we have the micro-USB port\nfor charging, which is a bummer in a USB-C dominated market.  \nYou also have the headphone jack and the speaker grill on either side of the\nUSB port.  \nSpeaking of the design, the smartphone has the standard candy bar 18:9 design\nwe\u2019d expect in this price and the curved edges make it comfortable to hold\nwith one hand.  \nAlthough reaching all corners of the phone isn\u2019t easy with single-handed use,\nit is fairly ergonomic.  \nOverall, the build and design of the Honor 7X is good.  \nThe 18:9 display is a good addition when compared to other phones in the same\nprice range.  \n  \nDisplay and Sound  \nAs we\u2019ve mentioned above, the smartphone has an 18:9 display for watching\ncontent.  \nWe faced no issue with the display on every day use. Apps that haven\u2019t been\noptimized for the new aspect ratio show a black bar at the bottom with the\noption to stretch it to full screen.  \nThere are however some apps and games, like Asphalt 8, that run in full screen\nand take advantage of the new display.  \nThere are some 18:9 specific videos on YouTube as well and if you are watching\nthe new Avengers: Infinity War trailer on the device, you can simply pinch to\nfit and enjoy the trailer in full screen.  \nOther apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, Chrome, etc. work well on the new\naspect ratio. No complaints here.  \nIf there is a complaint it\u2019s with the audio quality from the speaker.  \nWatching YouTube content including movie trailers, cinematic video game\ntrailers, talk shows, Ted Talks, etc. is very underwhelming.  \nThe background score of the movie trailer and the vocals seem muddled. The\nsame can be said for music videos.  \nWhen playing games like Asphalt 8, the audio from the speaker is underwhelming\ntoo and sounds muddled.  \nWhen taking calls on the speakerphone, the voice is clear but the maximum\nvolume is lower than what I\u2019d expect from a smartphone.  \nComing back to the display, it has a maximum luminance of 417 lux. It isn\u2019t\nthe brightest display out there and sunlight visibility does suffer, but if\nyou are going to read web pages or Kindle books, you should be fine with auto\nbrightness. You may want to bump up the brightness manually while watching\nmovies though.  \nFor those of you finicky about the colour temperature of the device, you can\nmanually change it between default, warm and cold. You also have the ability\nto manually adjust it to your preference. There's even an eye comfort mode\nthat essentially filters out blue light.  \nOverall, the display is very good and supports a pretty wide colour gamut. You\nwill enjoy watching movies on it, but audio is an issue.  \n  \nUI  \nThe Honor 7X has the company\u2019s own EMUI overlaying Android Nougat. The UI has\nsome interesting features. If you like, you can have an iOS-like layout where\nall the apps are present on the home screen. Or if you are one that prefers an\napp drawer, then that option is there too. The phone comes with a bunch of\npreloaded apps and games. There is one pre-loaded app I found quite\ninteresting. In the tools folder, there is a Mirror app. It essentially uses\nthe front-facing camera of the smartphone and you can zoom in as well if you\nwant. It has a bunch of mirror frames to choose from and in case you want to\ncheck out your hair before that big date, I suggest you give this app a shot\ninstead of opening the front-facing camera.  \n  \nThere is another interesting feature on the phone called WiFi bridge. Through\nthis, the current WiFI network can be shared with other devices. This is very\nuseful in a scenario where you have access to WiFi on only one device, but\nneed the access for other devices too. Do remember, this feature on the Honor\n7X is a battery guzzler.  \n  \nOverall, the UI is fairly fluid and if you have used an Honor phone in the\npast, you will feel right at home. There are times when the UI stuttered\nduring heavy multitasking and a few times when Facebook didn\u2019t respond, but\napart from that, the average user shouldn\u2019t face any issues.  \n  \nPerformance  \n  \nLet\u2019s talk about the call performance. The audio is crisp and clear at both\nends. The earpiece is loud and there is audio leaking when it is at full\nvolume. So, if you are in a car and the earpiece is at full volume, the person\nsitting next to you can easily eavesdrop on the conversation. At about 60%\nvolume, the earpiece works perfectly well. There are also some places in my\nhouse where the network is an issue but the Honor 7X managed to grab better\ncellular reception than other phones in this case.  \n  \nRunning everyday apps like Facebook, Whatsapp, YouTube, Netflix, and more is a\nbreeze. The smartphone multitasks well and stutters only when you run heavy\napps and games back to back.  \n  \nThe biggest downside to the performance of the smartphone was gaming. Casual\ngames like Farm Hero Saga ran well but graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8\nshowed patchy framerates. When there are a bunch of cars on screen, the\nframerate really drops. If you are one that wants to play graphically heavy\ngames on the device, you may want to look at other options.  \n  \nWhen it comes to benchmarks, the performance is at par with the Honor 9i and\nthis isn\u2019t surprising since both phones are powered by the same SoC. Here is a\nlook at the benchmark scores of the Honor 7X against some competing devices.  \n  \nOverall, the performance of the device is not groundbreaking, but it has just\nenough to keep the average user happy. There aren\u2019t any troubling heating\nissues with the smartphone either.  \n  \nCamera  \n  \nMoving to the camera, the Honor 7X has a dual camera setup with one 16MP\ncamera and another 2MP camera. Photos clicked in well-lit situations have\ncolours that are true to the source. However, for a phone priced around 15k,\nthere are smartphones with better cameras. Low light photos also present the\nproblem of noise especially when the light is really low. Since the smartphone\nhas a dual camera setup, you\u2019d expect it to click good bokeh photos. However,\nthat isn\u2019t the case. The bokeh photos are average at best and the camera on\nthe Honor 7X isn\u2019t as groundbreaking as they were on the Honor 6X, with\nrespect to their respective competitors. If a camera is of utmost importance\nto you, you are better off considering the Mi A1.  \n  \nBelow are some of the camera samples,Don't Forget to Check it out  \n  \nBattery life  \n  \nUsing the phone for about a week, the smartphone can last you a little more\nthan a 9 to 5 day with above average use. With brightness on auto, and 100%\nbattery at 10am the phone was at about 20% battery when I got home at 8PM,\nwhich is good considering usage. We made many calls and sent many texts during\nthe day, clicked some images, watched YouTube videos, Facebooking and some\nlight gaming. The smartphone lasted for about eight and a half hours on the PC\nMark Battery Test, which isn\u2019t the best in this category but it isn\u2019t bad\neither.  \n  \nHow it compares  \n  \nWhen you consider a 15K smartphone, you will look at devices like the Moto G5\nPlus and the Mi A1 to name a few. The Honor 7x has a better display than the\nMi A1, which means that you can enjoy movies on it a lot more. The 18:9\ndisplay also helps in this regard. However, the output from the speaker of the\nMi A1 is far superior. When it comes to everyday performance, the phone is\nsnappy and can give the Mi A1 a run for its money. Gaming performance on the\nHonor 7X could have been better.  \n  \nBottom Line  \n  \nFor Rs 15,000 device, the Honor 7X isn\u2019t the best option out there.  \nIt has a great display and good battery life and the overall performance is\naverage at best.  \nIt loses out to the Mi A1 as far as the camera is concerned and graphically\nheavy games like Asphalt 8 stutter on the device.  \nYou can consider it if you aren\u2019t a heavy smartphone user and like reading\ncontent or watching movies on the go, as the display on the smartphone is\nindeed good.  \nBut if the camera is something you are finicky about and aren't a fan of\nskinned OSes, then you may want to consider your options.  \n  \nif my Review helped you in anyways Please Vote it as HELPFUL.\n\n", "\n\n\u00a01) product design is simply awesome.it's much beautiful than it seen in\nimages, i suggest go for blue colour.  \n2) Display quality is better than any 16:9 displays phones as 18:9 display has\nfull hd plus display.  \nOnce you start using it when you looked to 16:9 displays of any phone of any\nprice range upto 20 to 25k phones, you will definitely not going to like the\ndisplay of such type of phones.  \n3) it is truly a bezzel less phone as seen in images.  \n4) Camera is better than 6x as you click images and zoom it honor 6x show some\npolished on faces that doesn't happen with 7x. Thanks for it.  \nThere is no use of camera of 2MP as it's bokeh effect software is not good.\nFront camera is better than Mi A1 i think.  \n5) battery life is good .  \n6) one thing that disappoint me about this phone.  \nThe day i purchased, i start watching video on YouTube but when i m sliding\nthe video from the buttom sometimes it will get hanged.

Low light photography is poor.Camera sometimes doesnt focus on object\nin low light.Bokeh effect is much better on Mi A1, in Honor 7x in bokeh images\ntheir is no sharpness on edges.

Even though the rear of the phone has a flat profile, which\ncompliments its 7.6mm thickness, it doesn't exactly sit in the hand\ncomfortably as a slightly curved back would have. That being said, the\nsmartphone does look attractive with its aluminum chassis which might not be\nas pleasant as the glass back on other flagship smartphones, say the Honor 9,\nbut does just fine in this price bracket.  \n  \nThe fingerprint sensor is located on the rear of the handset, and we found it\neasy to reach when holding the phone. The fingerprint sensor is quick to\nidentify the touch input and unlocks in a jiffy.  \n  \nThe bottom edge houses a 3.5mm headphone jack along with a micro USB port\nbeside the speaker grill. The left side of the smartphone has the hybrid dual\nSIM card slot which can either be used for two SIM cards or one SIM card and a\nmicroSD card.  \n  \nAt 165 gms and measuring 156.5 x 75.3 x 7.6 mm, the Honor 7X does feel like\nmore than just value for money.  \n  \nWe have to commend Huawei and Honor for the 5.93-inch display that they have\nmanaged to cram into a body that would traditionally accommodate a 5.5-inch\nscreen.  \n  \nThe FullHD+ (2160x1080 pixels) display as such provides a great experience\noverall and we found it to be bold and vibrant. Now, the 18:9 aspect ratio\nwith a pixel density that equals to 407ppi, the screen isn\u2019t anything like on\na flagship smartphone, but at this price, it is more than what anyone could\nask for.  \n  \nApps on the smartphone will run at 16:9 aspect ratio by default and users will\nget a pop-up of running a particular app in full screen 18:9 aspect ratio. To\navoid that, there is an option in Display settings through which a user can\nenable the fullscreen mode on different apps.  \n  \nThe Honor 7X also comes with an Eye Comfort mode in Display settings to filter\nout excessive blue light along with options to modify the colour temperature\nand brightness.  \n  \n\\------------------------------------  \nBattery and Display\ud83c\udf80  \n\\------------------------------------  \n  \nThe Honor 7X comes with a 3,340mAh battery that the company claims will last\nmore than a day. It also has an Ultra Power Saving Mode that will give that\nlast minute juice to the smartphone if any need arises.  \n  \nBattery life is something that has come a long way this past year with major\nimprovements. It is also one of the first things a user looks at while\npurchasing the smartphone.  \n  \nOn the Honor 7X, you\u2019ll be glad to know that it stays true to its claim in\nterms of performance. It\u2019s not game-changing, but considering the phone is\npowered by a 3,340mAh battery and powers an 18:9 aspect ratio display on the\nfront, it is more than sufficient for daily use.  \n  \nOccasional boost during the night or midway in the day can also help the phone\nlast longer than a day if you are a power user.  \n  \nWe also missed the fast charging which has become a common feature with\nsmartphones today. Sadly, Honor 7X doesn\u2019t support fast-charging capabilities\nso the phone won\u2019t get charged up quickly. It\u2019s a bit of a disappointment\nconsidering a lot of other mid-range phones now charge much faster than the\nHonor 7X.  \n  \nWe put the 7X through our standard battery test, which involves playing a Full\nHD video for 90 minutes from a full charge, at full brightness and with\naccounts syncing over Wi-Fi, and the phone had 78% battery left at the end of\nthe test.  \n  \nDual camera setup: 16MP + 2MP  \nGood performance in well-lit conditions  \nHonor 7X features a dual-camera setup on the back. It has a 16-megapixel\nprimary camera and a 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera on the back.  \n  \nComing to the performance of the rear camera, the Honor 7X delivers fairly\ngood images in optimal lighting conditions. The camera is snappy most of the\ntimes in focusing and capturing pictures at a blazing fast speed. The pictures\nclicked in good lighting environment came out to be punchy and detailed.  \n  \nThe 2-megapixel lens on board the Honor 7X works in the Portrait mode to\nachieve bokeh-like images. It essentially identifies the edges of the subject\nin focus and blurs out everything else.  \n  \nWe found that the 7X struggled to identify the edges of our subject resulting\nin an uneven blur around our subject. That also has a lot to do with the kind\nof light the subject is in. The camera also focuses slowly when it switches to\nthe portrait mode.  \n  \nIn low light, the Honor 7X cannot be trusted to capture a good image. Poor\nlighting is a real problem for the camera, and you can tell it\u2019s not as\npowerful as the ones on higher-end Honor handsets or flagship phones.  \n  \nThat said it does manage to keep pace with competitors such as the Nokia 6 and\nthe Moto G5S Plus, which are around the same price point.  \n  \nThe front camera is an 8MP shooter that also boasts a Portrait mode feature,\nwhich we found worked, but not as well as on the rear camera. The selfie\nshooter will take decent snaps for social media and the like, but it\u2019s nothing\nout of the ordinary.  \n  \nThere's a dual-camera setup on the rear of the Honor 7X, with a 16MP sensor\ndoing most of the heavy lifting and then a 2MP sensor to the side of it, which\nis dedicated to depth-sensing.  \n  \nWe've had a limited time with the camera so far, but taking the odd picture\nquickly has worked fast and given good results, though not anything mind-\nblowing just yet.  \n  \nWe'll be sure to play around with the improved wide aperture mode and further\ndepth sensing features for our full review, plus there's the Portrait mode\nthat we can't fully judge just yet.  \n  \nThere's also an 8MP front camera for your selfies. This comes with a few modes\nfor you to play around with and there's a depth of field feature here too. In\nour time with the phone, the front-facing camera captured some really good\nselfies in ambient lighting conditions  \n  \n\\--------------------------------------------  \nAndroid,Software,Perfomance and More...\ud83c\udf80  \n\\--------------------------------------------  \n  \nThe Honor 7X runs on Android 7.0 Nougat under the company\u2019s custom EMUI\n(Emotion UI) 5.1. Currently, there\u2019s no information available if the\nsmartphone will get an upgrade to Android 8.0 Oreo, which is a big deal for a\nphone that's launched almost 6 months after the Oreo release.  \n  \nSome of the latest features in Android such as multi-window support and the\nability to directly reply to texts and emails within the notification bar are\nalready present in this build of the EMUI 5.1, which are very beneficial in a\ngeneral use case.  \n  \nAfter going through the setup, users will be greeted by the homescreen which\nhouses all the apps in the phone. Now, I am not a great fan of this kind of\nhomescreen setup and thankfully, there is an option to enable the app drawer\nwhich opens up to a single page of apps users can scroll through.  \n  \nPre-loaded apps such as Emergency will allow users to set up call and SMS\nalerts. Huawei Health will monitor all kinds of dynamic activities such as\nwalking running, speed and other data that will be helpful for people looking\nto keep a track of their fitness. HiCare is another app that comes default\nwith the Honor 7X and is essentially a support system that lets a user\ninteract directly with the support in case of issues with the phone. Users can\nalso register their phone for warranty and early beta updates.  \n  \nHonor also provides a Phone Manager app with its smartphones that performs\ncleanup of cache, monitors mobile data, allows user to block phone numbers,\nscans for viruses, allows modification of permissions among other things.  \n  \nIn our usage of the Honor 7X, the EMUI 5.1 works pretty well. It was fluid and\ndidn\u2019t lag during our use. Interaction with the 7X went as smoothly as you'd\nexpect from a good mid-range smartphone these days.  \n  \nThe big 18:9 aspect ratio display on the Honor 7X makes it an apt smartphone\nto consume media on. Be it movies, videos or songs, the visual experience on\nthe 7X is amazing, to say the least.  \n  \nConsidering its price, the screen renders some really vivid and crisp pictures\nwhich makes this a great phone to watch videos on. There is infact a video\nplayer on the 7X which can play all kinds of videos on the phone.  \n  \nOn the other hand, the speaker on the smartphone isn\u2019t something that we\nlooked forward to. The audio output is average and one can use it\noccasionally. An issue which we faced a lot many times was the speaker being\ncovered with our hand when watching a video.  \n  \nOf course, with the retention of 3.5mm jack, one can always plug in a\nheadphone or earphone and can even go a step ahead and pair the phone with a\nBluetooth headset.  \n  \nIn our usage during gaming on the Honor 7X, we didn\u2019t face any problem.\nAlthough once we started playing high-end games which demand solid graphic\nprowess, the phone did stutter and struggled to render graphics.  \n  \nThat said, you\u2019ll be able to play a lot of popular, fewer graphics-intensive\ngames on the Honor 7X without experiencing any problems.  \n  \nKirin 659 processor performs well throughout a day  \n4GB RAM and 32GB/64GB internal storage  \n  \nThe Honor 7X is powered by the company\u2019s own HiSilicon Kirin 659 octa-core\nchipset, paired with 4GB of RAM which takes most of the load easily but we\nfound it was able to cope with everything we wanted to do on a daily basis.  \n  \nOn Geekbench 4, the Honor 7X scored 3579 which is an improvement on the score\nof 3,105 that the Honor 6X achieved.  \n  \nWhile the smartphone performs well normal usage, aggressive users may observe\nslow loading time while opening, closing or switching apps.  \n  \nUsers can also choose between 32GB and 64GB onboard storage wherein 12.5GB is\ntaken up by the OS. Other than that, Honor 7X comes with a number of\npreinstalled apps that we think most users wouldn't need. Games like Asphalt\nNitro, Bubble Bash 3, Danger Dash, Modern Combat 4 Zero Hour and Spider-Man:\nUltimate Power all come as a demo on the Honor 7X with an option to purchase\nthe game. Apart from gaming enthusiasts, these apps are worthless for the\nnormal user. Other website shortcuts like the Hi Honor, Honor and Honor\nCommunity are also present disguised as apps. UC Browser and UC News also come\npreinstalled on the 7X. Thankfully though, all of these apps can be\nuninstalled but it spoils the first impression of the phone.  \n  \nOverall, the performance of the Honor 7X didn\u2019t let us down in any way and was\nable to churn most of the things we threw at it. It manages to keep a balance\nbetween performance and efficiency which is what we liked about it.  \n  \n\\-----------------  \nVERDICT\ud83c\udf80  \n\\------------------  \n  \nIn a price segment dominated by the likes of Xiaomi Redmi Note 5/pro, Mi A1\nand Moto G5, the Honor 7X stands firmly with its large display packed inside a\nslim metal build. Still, if you want the best camera then Mi A1 is still ahead\nin the race, and similarly, Redmi Note 5 pro is a better option if you need a\nbig battery with solid mid-range hardware and a better camera.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 24 January 2018", "on 4 January 2018", "on 12 February 2018", "on 15 December 2017", "on 10 December 2017", "on 11 December 2017", "on 11 December 2017", "on 28 December 2017", "on 5 March 2018", "on 24 February 2018"], "reviewer": ["Eklavya19", "Kunalsingh156@amazon", "Vinay Arora", "Ritesh Yadav", "ravindra", "Amit Sharma", "Brando", "Ashish Kumar", "Avik Pandit", "Rashmita Dutta\ud83c\udf80\u2764"]}
