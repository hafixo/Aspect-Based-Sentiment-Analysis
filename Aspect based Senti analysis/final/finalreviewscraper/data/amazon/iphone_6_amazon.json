Front camera is\nAmazing considering its only 1.2MP, it takes amazing pictures.  \n  \nBattery back up is good, I was skeptical about this as most of them complained\nbut it's going very good as of now.  \n  \nPhone is quick, no lags, no hick ups, so this proves the argument that specs\ndoesn't matter.  \n  \nCall volume and clarity is good, you can hear the other persons voice clearly\nand loudly and I got the same compliment from the other end, speaker volume is\nvery good, loud and clear.  \n  \nOverall, I'm satisfied with the product it sure is priced higher comparing the\nspecs of other phones but I would say the experience is worth it and specs\ndoesn't define the phones performance.\n\n", "Worst product, and seems cheep and copied.. some time i cant even recive calls\nand use mobile cos it just hang, i have to wait till its battery goes off, to\nuse this mobile, other wise i cant make call, cant use any app its just\nstuck..\n\n", "Most worthless ph i have ever isued in my life. Battery quality is so so so\npoor, heating problem is also there further charging will take so much of\ntime. And main problem is that Amazon is not taking any resposibility for\nthat. I'm too much upset for that, i think the problem has occurred due to the\nuppur verson has already launched by Apple comp and they should stop selling\nIphone 6 on immediate basis and request to Amazon not to sale those ph which\nhad already two upper verson has release by the comp and give value their\ncustomers who are purchased product with their very hardearn money. So I would\nrequest all the buyer's or any person who interest to take this ph pls not to\nbuy this or those which has already upper version has released.\n\n", "Well, this might sound a bit weird, but the 32 GB version is noticeably slower\nthan the 16 GB version ! I had been using the 16 GB version of iPhone 6 since\na year and the less capacity of 16 GB made my phone memory full most of the\ntime. Thats when apple released the 32 GB version for around 28k and I was\nattracted to that. I gave off my 16 GB iPhone to my mother and I started using\nthe 32 GB one. Its been around 7 months of using the new 32 GB iphone, but one\nthing i found out was my old 16 GB version is much faster that than 32 GB\nversion ! The difference is easily noticeable when I use my new 32 GB and my\nold 16 GB phone back to back. The 16 GB one opens the apps very fast and is\nvery quick to respond. But my new 32 GB phone has a lag when opening apps and\nswitching apps. I thought this was an issue with my specific phone. Last month\nmy wife also bought a 32 GB gold iphone 6 and it also is slower. I think apple\nhas made some compromises in the hardware to bring the cost down in the new 32\nGB versions. Im disappointed with this.\n\n", "First of all I have to say thankyou Amazon India.  \nAwesome design 10/10  \nsuperb hardware10/10  \nsuperb software,no lagging10/10  \ncamera quality is so good even in low light 9/10  \nBattery is ok for day to day use.9/10  \nEarphone quality is 10/10  \nSpeker is loud10/10  \nno fast charging but not to worry  \nIts really fast 9/10  \nNo sim issues for Jio  \nTrust me Go for it.\n\n", "If you like android then go for one plus 3 I hated android so went with this\nand never ever in my life I am going for android again APPLE is the best and\nawesome performance and some unusual things ie it has the best vibrator\nmotor,external speaker,internal speaker and feels pretty awesome in the hand\nthe only negative is the battery but if you just turn down the brightness and\nyou can easily last a full day .

It\u2019s a very different look from the iPhone 5S, which has shiny machined\nedges. Barring some plastic detailing on the rear it\u2019s all glass and metal,\nand thus looks Great . This is a very satisfying phone to hold and to use\nalthough The white bezel on the silver version ruins the seamless effect a\nlittle.  \n  \nDisplay :  \n  \nWith its 4.7in display, Apple has had to up the iPhone 6's resolution in order\nto keep the Retina tag. According to Apple, this is the point at which you can\nno longer see individual pixels. In the iPhone 6's case, this is a resolution\nof 1,334x750 - slightly more than 720p. While the resolution may be higher,\nthe pixel density is the same 326ppi as the iPhone 5S. In other words, you get\nthe same screen sharpness as before.  \n  \nBattery :  \n  \nThe Apple iPhone 6 comes with a non-replaceable 1,810mAh battery and has never\nfailed to make it through the day, even with heavy use.  \n  \nPerformance :  \n  \nThis handset uses the Apple A8 SoC, which has a dual-core 1.4GHz CPU. Compared\nto the 2GHz+ quad-core Android competition, this sounds a little slow, but\neven after a heavy use it's preety fast .  \n  \nCamera :  \n  \nThe handset comes with a 8MP camera, 1/3.06-inch sensor, true-tone flash,f/2.2\naperture dual-LED flash, phase detection and the picture quality is preety\ngood .  \n  \nMain disadvantages:  \n  \n>Has unimpressive screen to body ratio (the Nexus 5 fits a 5-inch screen in\nthis size of a body)  \n  \n>No microSD slot  \n  \n>Pricey memory upgrades, 32GB version should be standard for such an expensive\nphone  \n  \n>No user-replaceable battery  \n  \n>Protruding camera lens makes the phone wobble if you don't have a case on  \n  \n>Camera is still merely 8MP four years in a row (granted, it's getting better\nevery with every new generation)  \n  \n>No 4K video and video sound is still mono  \n  \n>Lacks the optical image stabilization of the iPhone 6 Plus  \n  \n>No enhanced resistance to liquids or dust  \n  \n>Too pricey  \n  \nMy Opinion :  \n  \nAlthough the iPhone 6 is considerably bigger than the iPhone 5S, Apple has\ndone a good job not making it feel so. As such, this feels like the natural\nsuccessor to the older smartphone and a worthy upgrade - it's faster and the\nbigger screen really works, making the previous model look a little old\nfashioned.\n\n", "Today I ordered my product but when I open the box it\u2019s was totally empty  \nit was very disheartening for me !

With the new continuous surface of iPhone, all your gestures now feel\nsmoother than ever.  \n  \nWe also thought about how you use your iPhone every day and redesigned the\nbuttons to make it even easier to use. Elongated volume buttons are integrated\ninto the thinner profile, outlined to make them effortless to find by touch.\nAnd the Sleep/Wake button has a new home on the side of the device to put it\ncomfortably within reach.

Proper and timely delivery. Happy to get it for 27k\n(including cashback) in less than 24 hours.  \n  \nI was initially skeptical to purchase an iPhone 6 in early 2017. With its A8\nunit and 8 MP camera pitted against the newer specs in 6S and 7 really made it\nseemed an unattractive investment. But, I still went ahead due to the 32 GB\noption at this price point. Don't care which model Apple will announce in\nAugust this year.  \n  \nI'm happy to say that iPhone 6 runs pretty smooth on iOS 10.2 update and with\nover 50 apps installed.  \n  \nBattery is ok for business hours use. Need to recharge daily night.  \n  \nBoth the front/back cameras are above average and I'm happy with the clarity\nand quality of shots, even though the MP count on specs may force you to think\notherwise. This is a highly tuned camera and the shots are very good. I have\nalready captured few memorable shots with this.  \n  \nSlo-mo and video recording is also good.  \n  \nThe voice clarity and signal strength are great.  \n  \nDisplay is beautiful. UI runs smooth. I have disabled many notifications for a\nclutter free experience. iOS offers plenty of control over the device. This is\n2017 after all!  \n  \nNo comparison with Android. Very subjective opinion. I have owned Galaxy Note,\nGalaxy S4, Moto G2, Galaxy Note 4, Xperia Z1, OnePlus 3T, Redmi Note 4, et al,\nbut iOS is special.  \n  \nI'm not missing the 3D touch at all.  \n  \nThe 3.5 mm jack is also present :)  \n  \nI checked on Apple website and my device is original.

So, I thought\nit make sense to compare the prominet features that could help you to make\nyour decision easier  \n  \n** iPhone SE **  \n\u25cf This is a 4 inch phone that fits very comfortably into your hands and is\ngood for your wallet since the 16GB version costs around Rs.21,000  \n\u25cf This packs the same A9 processor, camera, fingerprint sensor and many other\nfeatures of iPhone 6S and 6s Plus  \n\u25cf The 12mpx camera is one of the best among phones around Rs.20,000. It\nsupports 4K videos, live photos, full HD slow motion video, etc.  \n\u25cf In terms of performance also, the phone stands one among the top in the list\nin the Rs.25,000 bracket  \n\u25cf If you dont like big screen phones, this is the best phone for you. But I\nwould say if you have used a bigger screen phone, you would definitely\nstruggle with this one since reading stuff on a 4 inch screen will be less\ncomfortable to you in comparison. In that case, spend this money on an Android\nphone and you will love it  \n  \n** iPhone 6s **  \n\u25cf The main difference 6s has over SE is that 6s has got 3D Touch and display\nzoom other than a bigger screen of 4.7 inches  \n\u25cf 3D touch is an amazing feature where the phone can understand the pressure\nyou put on screen while touching and can activate various functions like\ndouble click, left click or many other functions that could have been achieved\nby more than one click  \n\u25cf 6s also comes with a 128GB option while SE stops at 64GB  \n\u25cf 6s has got a larger battery, but there is not much difference in battery\nendurance due to the bigger display  \n\u25cf The selfie camera is also upgraded from 1.2mpx in SE to 5mpx in 6s  \n\u25cf So, if you are on a tight budget, but still want to go for an iPhone, this\none is the best choice. I bought the 32GB version for Rs.35,888 in Jun-17  \n  \n**iPhone 6s Plus **  \n\u25cf The only difference 6s Plus has over 6s is the screen size which is 5.5 inch\nand optical image stabilisation for main camera  \n\u25cf 6s Plus had been infamous for rumours that the phone could bend from the\npressures of your pocket, but Apple is reported to have addressed it by using\nhigh-grade aluminium  \n\u25cf Optical Image Stabilisation works can effectively eliminate effects of\ncamera shake and images are sharper. This is especially useful during low\nlight where the exposre is longer and there are more changes for your hand to\nshake or shiver during shooting  \n\u25cf The larger screen is good for watching videos, reading, etc. And if you are\na gamer, spending this much for a 5.5 inch phone makes sense. This is sold at\naround Rs.45,000 for the 16GB version  \n\u25cf The phone performance and battery endurance is very much similar to iphone\n6s  \n\u25cf If you dont have a need for a larger screen, I would not recommend to spend\nmore money, but iPhone 6s would do good for you. if you are serious on this\none, I would suggest to spend a little more and go for iPhone 7  \n  \n** iPhone 7 **  \n\u25cf iPhone 7 brings in a low of new features  \n\u25cf This comes with a 4.7inch display. The display is one of the best on\nsmartphones with a lot of new features. In practical, the display is brighter,\nvery easy on eyes and colour reproduction is more accurate  \n\u25cf The processor is upgraded to A10 and the camera sensor is also upgraded that\nexcels is low light photography. The dual camera system captures depth\ninformation  \n\u25cf There is no 3.5mm headphone plug, instead it packs the wireless earpods.\nHowever, it comes with a 3.5mm adapter that connects to the lightning port  \n\u25cf The phone is splash as well as dust resistant  \n\u25cf The jet black and red are the new colours iPhone 7 is sold in  \niPhone 7 is one of the biggest update and comes with a lot of exciting\nfeatures. The 32GB version is sold at Rs.49,000. If you are serious about\niPhone 7, you may need to think spending around Rs.60,000 for the black or red\nsince the phone does not look much different from iPhone 6s if not on these\ncolours  \n  \n** iPhone 7 Plus **  \n\u25cf This is only for those people who have got deep pockets. The base version is\nsold at around Rs.72,000  \n\u25cf The phone has got a bigger screen of 5.5 inch and a superior camera with\noptical zoom & telephoto aperture  \n  \n** Summary **  \n\u25cf Go for iPhone SE only if you use your phone mainly to make calls or if you\nare upgrading from a smaller phone. If you are moving from a bigger screen\nphone, the 4 inch display of this phone may not be that easier  \n\u25cf iPhone 6s is the phone that I recommend if you dont want to spend too much\nmoney, but would like to boast of your iPhone among your mates  \n\u25cf 6s Plus is not at all recommended because you will get iPhone 7 with a lot\nof new features if you spend a little more. However, if your only need is a\nlarger screen I wont stop you  \n\u25cf iPhone 7 is in a different league. Its the best iPhone available today\naccording to me  \n\u25cf If you are struggling to spend your hard-earned money, put it on iPhone 7\nPlus black or red where you will get an amazing gadget to show off.\n\n", "Damaged product, had to get it replaced from apple.\n\n", "Very worst product and of course this is a duplicate piece and Amazon is not\nresponding for my issues. Literally Amazon is not accepting any exchange or\nproduct support.  \nVery bad experience with this phone. Ultimately waste of money.\n\n", "\n\n\u00a0I purchased this phone during Amazon Great Indian Sale. I always used this\nphone with cover on it and handle it with care. After 3-4 months now I can see\nthat there are spots in the back side of the phone. Seems like there are\ncorrosion marks in the gold color. The color is peeling off. This is looking\nquite bad and it doesn't seem that the phone is only 5 months old. Since Apple\nis a global brand. I am in doubt whether Amazon is selling genuine product or\nnot. Please take some responsibility and provide a replacement of this phone.\n\n", "I know, \"iPhone is best this is what all iPhone users will say.  \n  \nBut I am just posting my view on same.  \n  \nI got the phone little late than expected but it's okay. That's not a concern.  \n  \nWas really happy to received it, got initial needful work with any new phone\nin 15-20 mins.hich was pretty good.  \n  \n1st issue came after 2 days, I observed that battery of the phone is weak, As\nmy wife is using I phone since 2.5 years I could easily differentiate.  \nThough my usage was little higher than normal but battery never used to last\nfor more than 3 to 4 hours.  \n  \n2nd issue- may be a software bug, suddenly my hotspot used to stop working (\nmeans for some times I could not create hotspot and that to when I needed to\ndo it on priority.  \nNot acceptable at all.  \n  \n3rd issue- on 11th or 12th day I don't remember exactly about which day but it\ngot suddenly switched off and started after 10 mins without any reason. On\nnext day, this happened again for 1 hour or so, I could see only apple logo on\nscreen big reason to worry for me. When it started, battery drained to 12%\nfrom some 70% odd. And I could not charg it again.  \n  \nI got disappointed, may be I have got phone with hardware issues but certainly\nI had huge expectations from Apple.  \nDiscussed the same with Amazon, they asked job sheet from Authorised service\ncentre which I got very easily as issue was genuine and easily got refund\nprocessed.  \n  \nExtremely satisfied with the service of Amazon and Especially apple authorised\nservice centre.  \nBut disappointed with iPhone. Sorry iPhone users, but this is what it has\nhappened. There were no lags in the phone except mentioned above, it was\nbuttery smooth.  \n  \nThanks for sparing time to read this.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 6 October 2017", "on 5 September 2017", "on 16 August 2017", "on 14 March 2017", "on 1 April 2017", "on 6 December 2017", "on 27 August 2017", "on 4 January 2018", "on 22 February 2018", "on 16 April 2017"], "reviewer": ["RIIK SARKAR", "Kunj goyal", "raghav pareek", "Yogeshwar Rao", "Amazon Customer", "Friendly Sparrow", "Akash Deep Sharma", "BasavarajuN", "Abhishek Das", "Saurabh Bharat Joshi"]},

And thanks to\nfew youtube videos which show that in china, its very easy to swap the memory\nmodule and repack the phone as NEW.  \n  \nBut I did a little bit of research on this model.  \n1\\. This phone has been launched in China & Taiwan in Gold version .  \n2\\. In April, the phone will be launched in Few European countries as well.  \n  \nVerdit: The phone is Genuine. It registered in Apple's website and shows 12\nmonths warranty.  \n( I have attached pics of the box for reference, serial numbers have been\nhidden for privacy & security)  \n  \nThe phone is arrived in a day of order. Amazon does a great JOB in delivery.\nThumbs up for that.  \niOS 10 is installed on the phone. Unlike 16gb version, where iOS 9 is\ninstalled.  \n  \nI was hoping iOS9, as iOS10 does reduces the performance of the phone.  \nMy Usage for the phone is Camera and storage. I wont be running many apps on\nthe phone. This is actually a second phone meant or entertainment. Thus iOS 10\nwill not be performance issue here.  \n  \nIphone 6 is a great phone, it had only one flaw, that the cheapest model was\n16GB variant. Today in keeping few apps, photos and music, 16gb memory is\nexhausted. But the 32GB version solves this problem.  \n  \nIphone 6 cannot be matched in the following aspects:  \n1\\. Looks: Slim profile with less weight  \n2\\. Camera: 8MP does a great job than many 12MP budget phones  \n3\\. Music : Apple music is amazing  \n4\\. Apps: Apps for iPhone are designed better than Android devices.  \n5\\. Overall feel of owing an iPhone is amazing.  \n  \nI would recommend this phone to people who have limited use like, email, music\n& camera. For them this phone is the best buy.  \nIf you can take apple care protection plan of Rs 4500, your warranty will be\nextended for another year. Even after using the phone for 2 years, your resale\nvalue of the phone will be at least Rs. 10,000.  \n  \nIf you are looking to get in the Apple ecosystem and have light usage, then\ndon't think twice. - Just go for it.  \n  \nIf you like my review, please hit the LIKE button.

Its\nonly purpose is to clear some doubts regarding the product.  \n\"All the views expressed in this review are are solely my own.\"  \n  \nLet me start the review by saying that, the 32GB variant of the iPhone 6 is\nexclusively only available on amazon.in and is not presently available on any\nother online or offline retailers!  \n  \nI found that, many fellow customers have some doubt about this 32GB variant.\nAnd, some of them are thinking that this one is a fake model!  \nMy friends, this one is not a fake model. Its an original product of Apple\nwhich runs under iOS 10.  \n  \nApple has never officially launched their iPhone 6 with 32GB internal storage\ncapacity!  \n  \nOne big thing to notice is that the 16GB variant of the iPhone 6 (which is\nalso available on amazon.in) has a price tag of Rs. 30,399/- whereas the 32GB\nvariant of the iPhone 6 is just available for Rs. 28,999/-  \nExchange offer of up to Rs. 8,550/- (it depends on the smartphone that you're\nexchanging) is available for the 32GB variant of the iPhone 6.  \nAlso note that the offer period ends on March 7, Tuesday.  \n  \nNow to some general specs:  \nThis one includes an 8MP rear camera with auto focus and 1.2MP front facing\ncamera. The phone has a display size of 4.7 inch (11.4 cm). As I had already\nsaid before, this smartphone runs under iOS 10 and also packs 1GB RAM along\nwith the 32GB internal memory.

In other words, your\nphone is becoming unresponsive to touch. And if you search around the net,\nyou'll see that this is a fairly widespread issue.  \n  \nApple finally gave the iPhone a much-needed rethink, and the result is a\nproduct that is more like its competition than ever before, but also stands\nout just as well, if not better, in a seriously overcrowded market. As always,\nApple has managed to deliver more power, better aesthetics, improved cameras,\nand all-new software.  \n  \nThere will be some who will miss that 4-inch screen size, maintaining that\nthey don't want a bigger display on their phone \u2013 but nearly all of those\npeople won't have spent any appreciable time with a larger device, and I\nbelieve that a good portion of you thinking you need a smaller phone will\nquickly come to appreciate the power a bigger handset brings, without\ncompromising quality.  \n  \nWell, with the Apple iPhone 6 we're looking at one of the thinnest and\nsleekest handsets in the market \u2013 still. It's got a strong combination of\nmetal back (which feels exceptionally premium, borrowing bucket loads of\ndesign language from the iPad Air) and the way the screen curves into the\nchassis gives it a slight lozenge feel. The iPhone 6 is still just as much of\na premium device as ever; not a lower-end version of a new flagship.  \n  \nThe rear camera is still 8 megapixels, but the lens and sensor have been\nimproved to allow for better low-light shots and colour accuracy. Videos can\nnow be taken with continuous auto focus and improved stabilisation. 120 fps\nslow-motion, which was introduced with the iPhone 5 s now coexists with 240\nfps slow-motion.  \n  \n4 K video recording is missing, and the iPhone 6 falls behind its competitors\nin this regard. Even if you don't plan on shooting all your videos at such a\nhigh resolution, it's nice to have the option to do so. The low storage space\nwould also make it very difficult to store 4 K videos.  \n  \nImages taken during the day were crisp with accurate colours and superb levels\nof detail. Closeups were brilliant, and even distant objects were captured\nvery well. Low-light performance was also admirable - the iPhone 6 works very\nwell indoors as well as outdoors, even with minimal artificial or ambient\nlighting. We were constantly surprised by how well shots came out - there was\nnoticeable noise but details were still well defined when seen at reduced size\non a screen. Photos came out looking as though they had been taken in far\nbetter light.  \n  \nSpecifications shouldn't fool you into thinking this phone is any less\npowerful than an Android flagship. If you've been waiting for a reason to\nditch an old phone and jump onto the Apple bandwagon, the iPhone 6 is one of\nthe best reasons to do so. If you're thinking of upgrading from an iPhone 4S\nor earlier, you'll absolutely love what the iPhone 6 has to offer. Naturally,\nthe difference won't be as stark for iPhone 5 or 5 S owners running IOS 8, and\nthey can easily stick with their current phones for another year or so unless\nthey really feel like splurging.  \n  \nI would finally say that if you are an apple lover and want to buy a apple\nproduct only and in a price range below 30,000 then go for this. The phone is\nno doubt awesome, premium looking and very nice to hold. The camera quality is\nalso awesome.  \n  \nNOTE--- There are more powerful android smartphones available in this price\nsegment in the market. You can also reconsider them.  \n  \nThanks  \nIf you have read my review till here, then please vote for me...............\n:-)\n\n", "Received some other phone in an iphone box.

I brought this phone rs24999 32gb.\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n\n", "First of all, THANK YOU AMAZON India.  \n  \nMy first phone, from online store.  \nIt was a big step for me, after hearing online stores are some time fraud\nalso...  \nBut i really trust amazon India.  \nEven they proved it.  \n  \nI got my iPhone 6 in 1 day delivery as they promised.  \n  \nWhen i opened the box, the feeling was speechless...  \nThe phone was fully covered with glass paper as brand new. Every thing was in\nthe box. (Ear phone, power adapter, lightning cable, sim ejector, and the user\nguide)  \n  \nAfter registration, 1st i checked my warranty. It is correct.  \nAlso i checked every accessories, it's all was perfect as brand new.  \n  \nI am reviewing my phone after 2 month of buying.  \nToday also i did not get any issues.  \nAccept heating issue, I noticed that when i playing heavy game, video editing,\nit realises some heat. May be the reason is for its aluminium body, cause\naluminium is one of the best thermal conductor.  \n  \nBattery backup is also good, with normal use it gives you full day backup. For\nheavy use it will give you 4 to 5 hours.  \nFrom zero to full charge it will take 50 minutes.  \nSound quality is really very good. Louder also.  \n  \nAnd the main thing is camera, even 1.3 MP front facing camera also gives you\nvery good clicks. And the back is crystal clear with 8 MP.  \n  \nFor my opinion, under 25k iPhone 6 32 GB is best budget phone.  \nAnd there is nothing to worry about the phone, after all there service centre\nis also gives you hassle free service.  \nYou can make a insurance for more safety, if you want.  \n  \nOnce again Thank You AMAZON India.\n\n", "Summary:  \nNot 5 star due to battery.

That is\nthe question I asked myself before buying . But trusting Apple, I plunged\nahead cuz I didn't want to buy a 70k phone for myself. Besides i had been\nusing my iPhone4 till 2016 and it did serve me well, but was quite lagging\nlately. Well I hoped if the 4 could be used , the 6 is definitely 2\ngenerations ahead.  \n  \nWell I was not totally wrong. It is still fluid and works well and serves the\npurpose I don't use it for gaming so can't say much but all my required\nproductivity apps, emails , messaging systems work flawlessly. Also the phone\nstill looks good and feels premium , no complaints there. So overall if it is\nserving me well why the 3 stars?  \n  \nWell couple of things which I don't expect from Apple  \n\\- There is a strange noise on the bottom right corner when you press the\nscreen. It's as if there is a space between the screen and the body of the\nphone. This kind of quality is not expected from Apple (remember the same\nissue was highlighted on the LeEco Max 2?)  \n\\- The Bluetooth works pretty strangely. Sometimes it gets connected,\nsometimes not. The same device (my Bluetooth speaker) works intermittently\nwith the phone. Even my other iPhone6 has the same issue so I don't believe\nit's a hardware issue. Many a times this phone doesn't even get discovered\nwith Bluetooth on.  \n\\- Selfies are really not worth taking with this phone.  \n  \nHence the 3 stars.  \n  \nRecommendation : If you are not a heavy user or someone who wants the latest,\nthis is still a worthwhile phone, but only at this cost. However if you are ok\nwith a smaller screen, go for the iPhome SE instead\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 24 August 2017", "on 21 August 2017", "on 6 October 2017", "on 10 March 2017", "on 16 July 2017", "on 10 April 2017", "on 10 May 2017", "on 4 January 2018", "on 7 August 2017", "on 1 July 2017"], "reviewer": ["Mr.Sanju", "Gairick Sachdeva", "Sachin", "Abhishek Singh", "Sourav Mitra", "Rahul", "Sheela", "Jitender Birua", "Amazon Customer", "Vikas Deshmukh"]},

This is my first apple product and I\nwas very much confused before buying this phone. I have seen a lot of negative\nreviews about this product and some have got defective piece, fake products,\nrefurbished phone etc. I have read lots of reviews and comparisons before\npurchasing, since I'm investing more than 25k for this phone. I was using\nandroid phones earlier, Samsung Htc etc, so I was not sure whether to go for\niPhone or not.  \nBut after 2 months of usage, I feels I have made right choice. The delivery\nwas fast and before expected date, also the product I received is completely\ngenuine and in perfect condition, thanks to amazon. I have confirmed the\nwarranty with apple website. 1 gb RAM in iPhone is far better than 3-4 gb\nandroid ph available in market. The camera is very good and it is up to my\nexpectations. There is not heating problems and also the phone never hangs\neven with lots of background applications. Only problem is with the battery\nlife, it discharges very fast and if you are using the phone continuously\n(movies, youtube, games etc) it will last for only 3 hrs max. But the best\npart is that when the phone is idle there is no discharge. Even with 20 %\nbattery the phone won't get switched off for 3-4 hrs.  \nPros: the brand value of iPhone  \nBeautiful, slim and unique design  \nGood camera and display  \nCons: battery drains out very fast  \nScreen is not gorilla glass, you will be in trouble if u dropped ph  \nSingle sim and no option for external memory card and expandable memory  \nLimited free applications in Apple Store  \nDisplay is not full HD  \nPrice is very high comparing to features and specifications .  \nOverall experience is very good till now and iPhone 6 met most of my\nexpectations\n\n", "Not even single star! I got a defected piece...\n\n", "I have 5s got broken but still going strong.Now had bought new Iphone 6 32gb\nfor amazing price still its freaky 16gb is costlier than 32gb:-) anyways here\nis my review. Quick delivery from amazon and iphone is really amazing its\nfresh and looking sexy, also conformed with apple warranty and IMEI tracking.\nJust started using haven't found any bug or hung or overheating. Time to\nrock!!:-)\n\n", "The charger not working. Seems like refurbished. Phone stopped working in 2\nmonths, I\u2019m asking for the bill these people are not sharing.\n\n", "Product ( apple iphone 6 32 gb ) are Damage piece ( screen clicking problem )\n\n", "I received a shoap instead phone.  \nVery poor experience with this..\n\n", "Really a nice phone  \nThe photo has been taken by iphone 6 by me but I do say that the iphone 6's\nbattery life is a lil less but it's still fine to use those doesn't stick to\ntheir phone for hours. Really iphone 6 is better than iphone 6s . A guy is\nwasting his 10-12k for the 6s js for a 3d touch and live photos which the 6s\nusers dont use often . The 6s n 6 has the same speed and no one minds half\nsecond!!! I also say that iphone 6s is better than the 7 . Atleast u have ur\nheadphone jack ....lolN let me tell u that iphone 6 is the lightest phone ever\ncreated by apple ......\n\n", "Phone is good no doubt but the offer which amazon kept was for 0% EMI\ntransaction, i took phone under this offer , but amazon team deducted the EMI\nintrest + GST on that ,when we tried to reach put them , they diverted to bank\nand bank was saying we didn't got any information for 0% EMI offer .  \nEMI transaction in amazon website, but still interest was charged. after\nreaching out amazon several times no resolution , they divert it to bank and\nbank divert it to amazon.  \n  \nAfter many call i got frustrated and left that issue unresolved , as whenever\nyou call to amazon team their representative don't know the issue and again\nyou have to explain the issue and they will ask for 5-10 working days but with\nno resolution.  \n  \nso never go for such EMI transactions. better pay full and happy.\n\n", "This review after using 20 days. Mobile working excellent battery life is\ngood. Superb Camera quality.  \nBut i visit to I Phone center they told me mobile ear phone is local not\noriginal...
