Works pretty well with my iPhone. The sound\nis amazing. The sound quality won't make you feel that it's a cheap headphone.\nI felt the sound is at par with my friend's klipsch headphones( that was worth\n3k) and even my friend was surprised with the quality.

In addition the Mic button is also not working.\nIts only 2 weeks passed bought from Amazon. Both the company Amazon and JBL\nhas such brand value , however the product selling is very pathetic and\nunsatisfactory. I will post this review on social network as well. Either the\nAmazon is selling duplicate product on the name of JBL or JBL has decreased\nthe making quality product. Don't buy any electronic product from Amazon .\n\n", "Worth for the price @Rs.699  \n  \nI wonder where the product is made from !! Is it USA or CHINA ?? Check the pix\n!!  \n  \nreceived it today oly !! works well !! hope it works the same for long !!\n\n", "This time too..after endless searches on google and youtube i bought this\nheadphones!  \n  \nIf you are looking for budget-friendly In-ear headphone with a decent bass and\nbetter treble with the mic then this earphone is a perfect option for you. In\nthe box, you\u2019ll get a warranty card and a tiny user manual. Along with it, the\nbox contains two pairs of extra ear tips for comfortability. Another pair of\near tips is already pre-installed with the earphone. It looks premium with JBL\nbranding on the product and It is very light in weight which helps you to\ncarry anywhere. It comes with a one-year manufacturer warranty. The multi-\nfunctionality mic also supportive feature of this earphone to change the track\nand to manage the calls effortlessly.  \n  \nComing to Build Quality..  \n  \nJBL C100SI is a dynamic, ultra-lightweight in-ear headphone of gold-plated 3.5\nmm jack. The three ear tips included in the box gives you perfect choice for\ncomfort in the fitting and helps to isolate the outside noise of the\nenvironment. The build quality is not that great but it is capable of rough\nuse. The wires are of length 1.2 meters which are easy to handle. But wire of\nthe JBL C100SI is very weak in terms of quality and it is not tangled free but\nit can be managed without any severe tangling. It comes with play/pause/next\nbuttons which are helpful for the users to control and enjoy the tracks\nfreely. With the inbuilt multi functionality mic, users can answer and manage\nthe calls effortlessly with a single touch of a button on the go and it can be\nuseful to record the calls too.  \n  \nLook and Feel  \n  \nJbl c100si in-ear headphones with mic is made of plastic but give a premium\nfeel in hand. It is having the glossy and matte finish plastic with JBL\nbranding on top of it and looks pretty nice out of the box. Also, it is having\nangular sort of a design. Ear tip is sleek in design and fits in ear perfectly\nand it won\u2019t come outside easily from the ears. There is no sign of metal or\nany other premium substances in this earphone but still, it is managed to keep\nthe high quality in this price tag. The cables are totally made up of rubber,\nbut they feel better as it is manageable from tangling. You will find the JBL\nbranding on the microphone as well as 3.5 mm jack.  \n  \nSound Quality  \n  \nThe sound is highly subjective for every user. Some people prefer certain kind\nof music and depending on that they judge it. JBL C100SI comes with a 20Hz \u2013\n20,000 Hz frequency and 16 ohms of impedance which gives impressive sound\nquality in both calls and music with decent bass and treble. The sound is\nclear but it bleeds only in high volume. The loudness and bass are beyond the\naverage and it has a good balance between bass and treble. The noise\ncancellation of the earphone is average and surrounding sound quality is also\nbetter...  \n  \nI wonder why people simply post negative reviews... Dont think this product is\nbad after seeing all those negative reviews.. its 100% value for money and its\noriginal! Trust me go for it without thinking further! Happy shopping... :)\n\n", "Poor Quality one side headset not hearing after 6 months.

I was previously using the Sennheiser CX213.\nThis product isn't any less compared to the sennheiser, I must say! Specially\nthe bass is better than cx213. Also, it has got a Mike which is missing in the\ncx213. Overall satisfied with this. Now lets wait and see it is robust or not,\nas my cx213 lasted for entirely 3 years since my purchase and it broke down\nonly after a mice tore down its wires!

This goes a step higher.\nThey fit perfectly in my ear and are very light n comfortable for long hours.\nThe sound is balanced with fairly distinct highs, lows n mids reproduction.\nThe bass is abundant yet tight. Wires are a little thin n seem delicate but\nthere has been no noticeable wear n tear even after months of usage. I picked\nthem for Rs 599. Simply brilliant for that price.

I will Discuss all the Questions asked Above and will\nalso Tell you How to Identify The Fake Product. And will give you a Solution\nFor Best Performance. Lets Begin the Review :  \n  \n================  \nUNBOXING REVIEW :  \n================  \n  \n1 - EARPHONE  \n  \n2- WARRANTY CARD  \n  \n3- ADDITIONAL EAR BUDS  \n  \n4- MANUALS  \n  \n=================  \nEARPHONE REVIEW : (3.5* out Of 5 Value For Money \ud83d\udcb0 )  \n=================  \n  \n4* out of 5 for Premium Looks.  \n  \n4* out of 5 for Build Quality.  \n  \n4* out of 5 for Comfortable.  \n  \n3.5* out of 5 for Sound Quality  \n  \n3.5 * Out of 5 for Bass Quality.  \n  \n3* out of 5 for Treble.  \n  \n3* out of 5 for Noise Cancellation.  \n  \n3.5 * out of 5 for Ear bud Quality  \n  \n==============================  \nADVANTAGES / Why Should You buy :  \n===============================  \n  \n1- Premium Looks at this price Range  \n  \n2- Good BUILD QUALITY in this Price.  \n  \n3- JBL is a trusted Brand.  \n  \n4- Good Comfortable while Listening.  \n  \n5- It has a Mic .  \n  \n6- Warranty Of 1 year.  \n  \n===========================================  \nWHY I Gave Medium Ratings/Value For Money \ud83d\udcb0=3.5*  \n============================================  \n  \nI got Really Disappointed as for Quality of sound. These are the cons i Felt.  \n  \n1- Quality of Sound is not above Average. In this price range We can get\nHigher Quality of Sound from Panasonic she, Skull candy. I was Expecting alot\nfrom JBL.  \n  \n2- i am not happy with the noise cancellation for a Earphone of price 1399\n(without offer). I expect alot as i am a Music Lover.  \n  \n3- Mic is not that Clear , Low voices are Difficult to transmit. Not at all\nhappy with this.  \n  \n4- If You are really a Music Lover or you like Quality of Music always , i\nwill not Recommend you. There are other options in this Price range.  \n  \n=======================  \nHow To check Fake Product :  \n=======================  \n  \nStep 1- In front of the Box , Under C100SI you will see its Written \"In EAR\nHEADPHONES\". It Must be Written in white Colour. If its Written in Red or\nanyOther ,its a duplicate.  \n  \nStep 2- Turn the Box to back side , Your price will be written in a separate\nPaper. (Small) like a Sticker. Duplicate will have a Big Sticker.  \n  \nStep 3- Open the Box , In orginal You will get Warranty card but Not in\nduplicate.  \n  \nStep -4 : The size of Mic should be Small, not a wide in comparison with\nDuplicate.  \n  \nStep -5 : JBL logo should be Bold and written with Premium .  \n  \nStep 6- Go to YouTube , Check bass Checking Videos ,if your Earphones are\nsustainable ,then your is orginal.  \n  \n=================================  \nHow to Enhance / Get Better Efficiency :  \n=================================  \n  \nIf you have already Purchased it and thinking how to Increase the bass and\nQuality, i will recommend Go to Play store, there are plenty of Music apps\nwhere to customize basses and all needs. I will suggest Go for POWERAMP music\nplayer. I personally In Love with that app.  \n  \n=============  \nCONCLUSION :  \n=============  \n  \nThis product which is 1399 (without Discount) is really Not Worthy for Value\nof Money. But if this Product is Under 699 (offer) than its a Good Deal if you\nwant a Mic . So for me VALUE FOR MONEY \ud83d\udcb0-= 3.5 *  \n  \n============  \nMY OPINION :  \n============  \n  \nIF You want a Earphone which have A premium Looks with mic Under This price\nRange then Go for it.  \n  \nIf you want an Earphone Under 500 , Go for Philips Extra Bass . For Mic Mi In\near.  \n  \nIf you want an Earphone under 600-650, Go for Panasonic she , for MiC Sony MDR\n150 Ap.  \n  \nIf You want an Earphone under 700-800, Go For Cx 180, for Mic Go for this\nproduct.  \n  \nIf You want an Earphone under 1000k Go for One piston.  \n  \nIf you want an Earphone under 1200k Go for SONY MDR XB 55.  \n  \nIF YOU want an Earphone under 2K with mic Go for SONY MDR XB 55AP.  \n  \nI have Used all the products and Recommending you. If you want those Reviews,\nGo to my profile and check the Reviews..  \n  \n=====================  \nWas my Review HELPFUL :  \n======================  \n  \nI hope i have Discussed all the questions asked above. If you still have some,\nYou can comment Below .i will Help you as soon as possible.  \n  \nSorry For this Long Review, Thanks For Your Patience. Have a Safe and\nProductive Day ahead.

Product was good sound quality is\ngood and clear but it stopped working after 6 mnts.. And it is a big task to\nclaim the warranty .. Although its a big company they not even respond u\nproperly.. I tried to claim my warranty but they not even attend the calls or\nrespond to my mails.. So.. If u wanna buy it irrespective of the warranty it's\ngood to buy..\n\n", "I have previously used the JBL T100A and when I switched to c100si I feel that\nthe bass is a bit low in this one but the sound clarity is good.You can\ndefinitely buy this one if you're more inclined to a balanced or neutral sound\ntone.If you're a bass head then I would recommend you to buy Sennheiser CX180\nwhich has good bass.\n\n", "This product is quite decent with good sound quality. Not really recommend if\nyou are looking for outstanding experience because there are many other brands\noffering much better quality sound quality for similar price range.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 26 November 2017", "on 15 May 2017", "on 29 September 2017", "on 28 January 2018", "on 9 October 2017", "on 18 March 2018", "on 16 October 2017", "on 10 November 2017", "on 22 October 2017", "on 27 July 2017"], "reviewer": ["Dharmesh Vithalani", "Ragul Kumar", "Yathartha Saraswat", "Anuraag Singh", "Guddu", "Customer", "Raghav", "Saikumar", "Nikhil S Joseph", "Neel"]}
