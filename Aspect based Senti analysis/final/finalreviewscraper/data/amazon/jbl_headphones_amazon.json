About the product :  \n  \nPros first  \n1\\. Best BASS.... It is substantially more than Sennheiser CX213  \n2\\. Noise Cancellation is also better than cx 213  \n  \nCons  \n1\\. Vocals could have been better.  \n  \nIf you want a decent sound quality and good pair of earphones with above class\nbass, just go with these. Typically American product. Fits better too.\n\n", "JBL earphones are my favorite one.  \nYou would get excellent sound quality for sure. For those who are searching\nfor good sound in affordable price and who really fond of listening good\nshould go for it with the eyes closed.  \nActually, I had bought in Jan of last year and unluckily, I lost it. But,\nAgain I bought the same model because It's long lasting and is really good for\nwhom who have short of cash.  \nHope, My review help you in buying a good earphone.\n\n", "C100SI headphones from JBL is one of the best budget earphones if you prefer\nusing smaller sized in ear headphones rather than on ear set. Lets review the\nJBL C100SI dynamic wired headphones and see what it has to offer.  \n  \nThe headphone packaging comes with a user manual, 1 year warranty card and two\nextra pair of earbuds of different sizes. It is available in red, white and\nblack colour. If we talk about the design, the earphone is completely made in\nplastic with a classy JBL logo at the housing body. It also comes with a\npinhole speaker at the housing for noise cancellation and base compensation.  \n  \nLike we see on most of the JBL earphones the ear buds are quite soft and\ncomfortable to wear.The best part of this earphone is that it comes with a\nmicrophone which is a major add on. The mic is attached to a controller with a\nbutton which can be used for various functions like play/pause, receiving and\nending calls, skipping to next track and much more. However, there is no\nvolume control option in the controller.  \nCable is 1.2 m long but it is not the tangle free type of chord and the cable\nquality is decent. It comes with a 3.5 mm gold plated jack which ensures\nbetter connectivity. The headphones have a frequency response range of 20 \u2013\n20000 Hz and impedance rating of 320 Ohms.  \n  \nIf we talk about the sound quality, it has a descent and powerful enough bass.\nThe treble action also feels fine but it lags a bit in mids due to which\nvocals sometimes might sound unclear. The overall sound quality is amazing and\nupto the mark.\n\n", "Hi,  \n  \nBought these earphones recently, based on some good reviews across the web.\nWhile watching some reviews on youtube, I noticed that the design of the ear\nplugs is very good. So wanted to give it a try. Here are my observations.  \n  \n============  \nBuild Quality  \n============  \n  \n\\+ Quality of the plastic casing and cables is very good. The quality exceeds\nthe price level of Rs. 800.  \n\\+ Seems to be durable enough and can tolerate some rough handling  \n\\+ Mic and a single button remote are intelligently provisioned in the cable\njunction. Easy to find the remote when needed.  \n\\+ 2 additional ear buds of Small and Large sizes are provided. Medium size\ncomes fitted to the drivers.  \n\\- No carry case. A cloth pouch should have been included.  \n  \n===========  \nDesign  \n===========  \n  \nConsidering that the earphone is sold for around 800 bucks, one cannot ask for\nmuch, but believe me this earphone is beautifully designed.  \n  \n\\+ The angle of ear plug is very accurate and should fit most of the ears\nperfectly. Remember, good seal is one of the very important aspects of in ear\ntype earphones.  \n\\+ Sound isolation is good.  \n\\+ It is available in good color options.  \n  \n==============  \nSound Quality  \n==============  \n  \nComing to the purpose these are made for. The Sound....  \n  \nThe sound is amazing and engaging. The sound signature is so good that you\nwant to keep listening to your favorite tracks all day....these earphones by\nfar outperform their price class.  \n  \n\\+ V shaped sound signature, which is enjoyable and brings life to any track  \n\\+ Very good sound stage with clear separation of instruments  \n\\+ Good bass. Not overwhelming but punchy enough.  \n\\+ Can be driven easily due to the low impedance rating.  \n\\+ Smooth sound suitable for long listening without any fatigue  \n\\- Mids may be slightly rolled off in certain tracks. But this is expected\nwith a V shaped sound.  \n  \n===========  \nVerdict  \n===========  \n  \nSimply go for it...If you are looking for a budget earphone for daily use with\nyour mobile for handling calls and good quality music, you need to look no\nfurther. It is the best in-ear in this price range.  \n  \nHope you will find my review helpful. Cheers.\n\n", "Close ua eyes and buy them .  \nI have been using these earphones from last one month sound output is awesome.\nSame is the bass .mic is also doing a good job because of which call quality\nis very good....  \nOnly thing where it could have been improved is the built quality I am not\nsaying it's bad either. It's buit quality is good.but not upto the mark like\nsennheiser cx 180 ..that is why I am giving it 4 stars otherwise I would have\ngiven in 5 stars..thanks 4 reading.\n\n", "I ordered this product (JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic) 5 days\nback.Finally they delivered it today.  \nThough it was bot late from Amazon but it was worth waiting for the product.  \nMy 1st earphone was also JBL and i was totally satisfied with that.  \nThis is my second JBL earphone and as expected JBL did not disappoint me.  \nI have used this for one day and here is my review.  \n  \nPros:  \n  \n\\- Design is very good.  \n\\- You feel comfortable while you put it in ear.  \n\\- It is a perfect combination of BASS and treble.  \n\\- If you are a sound freak then this is the product for you.  \n\\- I am using it with my Honor 5x and I am totally satisfied. Thanks to JBL.  \n  \nCons:  \n  \n\\- Length of wire is little bit less.  \n\\- They did not provide any pouch this time.  \n  \nDon't think about it . Just go for it.\n\n", "Awesome earphone i was waiting for this type of earphone. Its music and bass\nare very good .in my view this one is best ever earphone with mic.  \nThe mic is place between both the earcords. And we can talk easily with this\ntype of earphone.  \nThe price is also in budget \u20b9569.In the range of 999 we can any one with mic\nwith all possible features and comfort but not like this one.Its the best one\n. I will rank it No.1.\n\n", "Excellent clarity and bass output. On the very same day received a Bose and\napple headphone from my sister as gifts, but this product matched with their\noutput, but may be bass wise sony headphones do tend to beat them all but Sony\nheadphones can't be heard for a long time due to its immense bass output.  \nMoreover received the product within 2 days.\n\n", "Was worth the money. awesome product with this price range. Before buying this\nproduct I was confused between audio technica clr 100 and this one , but the\nsound clarity of this headphone is awesome the bass is not so high, the build\nquality is average. It must be the best option for a music lover under 1000\nRs.But if you are a bass lover then don't go for it because it doesn't make\nyou feel the BOOM BOOM feeling .\n\n", "Hi,  \nI got Such a good earphones from amazon.when iam listening music this will\ngive extra beat with the complete details in the music. Noise cancellation is\ngood and another thing is which is perfectly fit for my ears. When you buy\nthis product you will get two extra earbud for your fit.  \nGood built quality  \nWirel ength is comfortable  \nComfortable fit  \nNo other irritations for ear  \nMic position is also perfect  \nSize of the ear phones are small and perfectly in the ear.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 31 January 2018", "on 5 December 2017", "on 8 October 2017", "on 2 January 2017", "on 3 November 2017", "on 8 July 2016", "on 22 November 2017", "on 22 January 2018", "on 15 November 2017", "on 1 November 2017"], "reviewer": ["Rishabh Rajbhar", "Amazon Customer", "udayan nayak", "Pavan.K", "Ahmed", "Preetam", "SAMEER RM", "DIPABRATA SUR", "Santanu Saha", "Alex"]},

Best sound. of course this is the trade mark of JBL earphones  \n3\\. Value for money. the pair of earphones i purchased at Rs. 710 (100 bucks\nextra as compared to boat earphones) which way way more worth than boat\nearphones.  \n4\\. Build quality. although it would seem like the earphones are delicate, yet\nit has the nice build quality. of course you have to be careful when you are\nin a rush (like Mumbai Local train) otherwise it has good quality cables.  \n  \nThe only con is that there are only 2 colour options (Black and White). the\nonly side where Boat and JBL earphones win. seriously i am a big fan of colour\ncombo like Blue and Black, Red and Black or yellow and white. but, this would\nbe subjective for different buyers.  \n  \nIf you want a great earphones at the price of less than 1,000, go grab this\ninstead of wasting your time on reading my feedback.:)\n\n", "Amazing product.

I will Discuss all the Questions asked Above and will\nalso Tell you How to Identify The Fake Product. And will give you a Solution\nFor Best Performance. Lets Begin the Review :  \n  \n================  \nUNBOXING REVIEW :  \n================  \n  \n1 - EARPHONE  \n  \n2- WARRANTY CARD  \n  \n3- ADDITIONAL EAR BUDS  \n  \n4- MANUALS  \n  \n=================  \nEARPHONE REVIEW : (3.5* out Of 5 Value For Money \ud83d\udcb0 )  \n=================  \n  \n4* out of 5 for Premium Looks.  \n  \n4* out of 5 for Build Quality.  \n  \n4* out of 5 for Comfortable.  \n  \n3.5* out of 5 for Sound Quality  \n  \n3.5 * Out of 5 for Bass Quality.  \n  \n3* out of 5 for Treble.  \n  \n3* out of 5 for Noise Cancellation.  \n  \n3.5 * out of 5 for Ear bud Quality  \n  \n==============================  \nADVANTAGES / Why Should You buy :  \n===============================  \n  \n1- Premium Looks at this price Range  \n  \n2- Good BUILD QUALITY in this Price.  \n  \n3- JBL is a trusted Brand.  \n  \n4- Good Comfortable while Listening.  \n  \n5- It has a Mic .  \n  \n6- Warranty Of 1 year.  \n  \n===========================================  \nWHY I Gave Medium Ratings/Value For Money \ud83d\udcb0=3.5*  \n============================================  \n  \nI got Really Disappointed as for Quality of sound. These are the cons i Felt.  \n  \n1- Quality of Sound is not above Average. In this price range We can get\nHigher Quality of Sound from Panasonic she, Skull candy. I was Expecting alot\nfrom JBL.  \n  \n2- i am not happy with the noise cancellation for a Earphone of price 1399\n(without offer). I expect alot as i am a Music Lover.  \n  \n3- Mic is not that Clear , Low voices are Difficult to transmit. Not at all\nhappy with this.  \n  \n4- If You are really a Music Lover or you like Quality of Music always , i\nwill not Recommend you. There are other options in this Price range.  \n  \n=======================  \nHow To check Fake Product :  \n=======================  \n  \nStep 1- In front of the Box , Under C100SI you will see its Written \"In EAR\nHEADPHONES\". It Must be Written in white Colour. If its Written in Red or\nanyOther ,its a duplicate.  \n  \nStep 2- Turn the Box to back side , Your price will be written in a separate\nPaper. (Small) like a Sticker. Duplicate will have a Big Sticker.  \n  \nStep 3- Open the Box , In orginal You will get Warranty card but Not in\nduplicate.  \n  \nStep -4 : The size of Mic should be Small, not a wide in comparison with\nDuplicate.  \n  \nStep -5 : JBL logo should be Bold and written with Premium .  \n  \nStep 6- Go to YouTube , Check bass Checking Videos ,if your Earphones are\nsustainable ,then your is orginal.  \n  \n=================================  \nHow to Enhance / Get Better Efficiency :  \n=================================  \n  \nIf you have already Purchased it and thinking how to Increase the bass and\nQuality, i will recommend Go to Play store, there are plenty of Music apps\nwhere to customize basses and all needs. I will suggest Go for POWERAMP music\nplayer. I personally In Love with that app.  \n  \n=============  \nCONCLUSION :  \n=============  \n  \nThis product which is 1399 (without Discount) is really Not Worthy for Value\nof Money. But if this Product is Under 699 (offer) than its a Good Deal if you\nwant a Mic . So for me VALUE FOR MONEY \ud83d\udcb0-= 3.5 *  \n  \n============  \nMY OPINION :  \n============  \n  \nIF You want a Earphone which have A premium Looks with mic Under This price\nRange then Go for it.  \n  \nIf you want an Earphone Under 500 , Go for Philips Extra Bass . For Mic Mi In\near.  \n  \nIf you want an Earphone under 600-650, Go for Panasonic she , for MiC Sony MDR\n150 Ap.  \n  \nIf You want an Earphone under 700-800, Go For Cx 180, for Mic Go for this\nproduct.  \n  \nIf You want an Earphone under 1000k Go for One piston.  \n  \nIf you want an Earphone under 1200k Go for SONY MDR XB 55.  \n  \nIF YOU want an Earphone under 2K with mic Go for SONY MDR XB 55AP.  \n  \nI have Used all the products and Recommending you.

Because\nwhen i purchased i was very confused that which headphone i should by. i\nresearched a lot but not found any satisfaction because in some headphones\nMike was missing and in some headphone the bass was not good. My budget was\nalso around 700 so I decided to choose the best of budget with nearly all\nquality. So i chooses them. So you can purchase them my friend. I know that\ndifferent type of headphone are there in your mind. But if you want a complete\nheadphone with mike and remote you should by them.One of my friend has\nJBLT100A they are also nice. he is using them with his redmi note 3.  \n  \nIf you are LeEco le2 user then please do not buy them because the output from\nthe adapter is not good and you will not get the actual sound of these\nheadphone. Because le2 do not have 3.5mm jack. le2 user should choose\nBluetooth headphone or the CDLA headphone.  \n  \nLet me tell you the alternative of it with there cons in this budget  \n1)senniser CX180  \ncons- No mike and remote so disappointment  \n2)Boat headphone  \nGood but we want a big brand  \n  \n====================================================================================================================================================================================================================  \n  \nHope you guys understood. PLEASE support me and upvote me so that my effort\ncan be appreciated.  \n  \n============================================================================================================================\nCHECKOUT MY PHOTOS THAT I UPLOADED======================\n\n", "My experience and product detail -  \n  \nHi guys recently I purchased JBL C100SI in-ear earphone. this is very nice\nearphone. sound quality of these earphone is best ever I used. best thing is\nthat bass is very nice and clear. with this earphone we get extra ear buds\nsets of different sizes. so we can set it according to your ears. normaly we\nget 1m length of wire but in this we get 1.2 m length.  \nthe body of speaker part is not too big we can easily use them when we sleep.\nlooks of this ear is very pretty and in white colour it looks damm cool. I am\nusing this earphone from last month so my experience is very good. I got this\nearphone in sale so I feel very very lucky because this item is worth of money\nat its original price and I got it at huge discount. if you are going to\npurchase it believe me your decision is very smart.  \n  \nBest ear phone under this range -  \n  \nThe jbl c100si is the best earphone avaliable in market because of its price\nand quality .the bass of this earphone is good as per the the price the\ntriable us fantastic and the main thing about the earphone is it will got a 1\nyear warrenty .if u buyed this on amazon great indian sale than u will get it\nfor rupees 599  \n  \nThe best earphones with mic under 800  \n  \nbest sound quality -  \n  \nThe JBL C100Si earplugs are really a blaster and have crystal clear sound\nquality!  \n  \nI am using this earplug since last 3-4 months and now I am addicted to music\ndue to it. It feels really rocking while I listen to music in these headphones\nand JBL has shown its worth by producing such awesome sound gadgets.  \n  \nLook wise the earphone looks nice and well but perform better than any other\ncompany's gadgets.  \n  \nThese are a bit costlier than others prevailing in the market but can prove\nthe reason behind high cost by its sound quality and clarity.  \n  \nI am in love with the headphones and at an overall point of view, I would say\nthat true sound quality can only be judged through the JBL headphones.  \n  \ntrust me it is a best deal....\n\n", "You might have seen thousands of earphones, maybe there are people who tend to\nchange the earphones every two three months, im a music lover and i do have\nmany earphones before this and this is my second JBL earphones, im very\nimpressed with JBL wire quality as it last very longer and also prevent your\nheadphone wire from tangles, my older earphones are not at all damaged, they\nare with me from last 2 years, and so it got me to get this JBL earphones.  \n  \nWHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS EARPHONES:  \n* The bass for sure it adds the extra bass to the music tracks  \n* The wire quality  \n* It is sweat proof not mentioned anywhere but let me tell you i use this earphones for my GYM and the are just working fine till date  \n* The rubber bud quality is also up to mark it will not disappoint you, wont get hard enough after a year too.  \n* Comes with a 1 year warranty.  \n* Supports all iPhone  \n  \nWHAT I DONT LIKE:  \n* The design of the earphone is in such a manner that it automatically slips out of your ear while Running  \n* Im 6.2 in Height and the wire is bit Short but you can manage that very easily  \n* It sure adds that extra bass to the sound track but when you listen to classic music its doesn't goes that well. the terrible is low if you are one of  \nthe gazal and classic songs listener then i will not suggest you this\nearphones.  \n  \nThe brand and the affordability makes this headphone a best buy under a price\ntag of just 700Rs, you should definitely buy this if you are looking for a\nstock headphone replacement.Reviewing a product does takes hours and i do them\nfor you all so that before buying you get an idea of the product, i would\nrequest you to take a moment of your time and mark this review as helpful if\nit helped you, it keeps us motivated Thank you so much :)\n\n", "Pro: Good bass. Good for music.  \n  \nCons: Everything else.  \nNoise cancellation is bad. Does not have volume control. The button on the mic\nworks on its own whims.  \n  \nSo buy it if you\u2019re going to predominantly use it for music and not talking.  \n  \nPersonal Grievance: the ear bud on one side was broken. Even though I pointed\nit out to the delivery man. He said it\u2019s not Amazon\u2019s responsibility. I\u2019d have\nsued both the seller and Amazon if I had more free time.  \n  \nPS: It\u2019s the first time I ever faced problem with a product I purchased from\nAmazon.\n\n", "Price : I got it at a cheaper price for just 699r  \nso, after 1 week of usage .Review time !  \n  \nContents of the Package :  \nHeadphones ,user manual ,ear buds(s,M,L) and A warranty card.  \n  \nBuild and Durability : the Body is completely plastic and flexible too.there\nis a clear Brand mark Of JBL over the ear Piece .the body looks durable enough\nby the looks of it.the buds are comfortable and doesn't falls off .the mic is\non the center of the headphones,making it difficult u to speak through it, u\nhave to held it close to ur mouth in order to speak through it ,otherwise it\nis not audible to the listener.  \n  \nScore :7/10  \n  \nClarity & Bass: the Name Jbl speaks for itself there is no stretching of sound\neven at higher volumes ,a good aspect for me.the bass is normal not deep bass\n, there is a noise cancellation feature which makes the sound appear pleasant\ntoo.Bass gets a little too loud rather than getting deep at higher Volumes .  \n  \nSore : 7/10  \n  \nPros :  \n-Noise Cancellation  \n-Voice clarity  \n-Comfortable Buds  \n-Looks Good.  \n-Good Bass.  \n-Firm Grip.  \n  \nCons:  \n-Mike not upto mark.  \n-No deep Bass.  \n  \nConclusion.  \nOverall a nice headphones under 1000rs.only thing is that mike is not upto the\nmark,i would suggest to go for the black variant as it would not get dirty and\nlooks cool too.  \n  \nClick the helpful Button if u liked it.  \nThanx.\n\n", "First thing, I got the notification regarding delivery of earphones on Sunday\neven though I had not received them! I contacted customer service and the lady\nassured me not to worry as the delivery partner had scanned wrong code for\nwrong delivery. It happened with me for the second time. First time was few\nmonths ago when I had ordered kaspersky antivirus. I think they do it on\npurpose to boast about fast delivery record!  \nAnyways, the earphones arrived 2 days later and the first impression regarding\ndelivery wasn't so good as there was simple plastic bag without bubble wrap,\nprobably because product costed less. Still, I don't think it would've costed\nAmazon too much to add bubble wrap.  \nEarphones were in a plastic box, so they were safe anyway, but bubble wrap is\na nice touch, so I request Amazon to add it again even for deliveries under\n1k. The plastic box was also not properly sealed on both sides (no tape or\nanything on one side. Could easily open in 1 second). Thus, at first I\nsuspected a used product but earphones were tucked inside properly like new\npair and also didn't feel like used when took them out. I'd recommend proper\nsealing to manufacturers, just to eliminate doubt!  \nEarphones are not so sturdy looking. A thin wire as compared to my previous\nearphones which came with my Nexus 5. They lasted 3.5 years and were nice.  \nPerformance wise, bass is just about OK, treble is more pronounced and mids\nsound flat. Voice of artists and mid notes lack punch. If you intend to listen\nto voice details in songs like classical singing, natyageet, bhaktigeet, or\nrate voice of an artist like Arijit, Anand Bhate, Mahesh Kale, Rahul Deshpande\nabove music, then you'd be a little disappointed.  \nOf course, I am saying this because I also own Sennheiser HD 202 II headphones\nand they are just amazing for sound details, clarity and overall sound\nexperience. I understand that these two are from totally seperate catagories.\nBut I just want to say, if sound (and specially voice in songs) is of utmost\nimportance to you, please try different brand, preferably Sennheiser.  \nMic is good. Made couple of calls and the other person could hear me perfectly\nwithout issues. Changed songs with the button (play, pause, next, previous\neverything worked well). At home, I use Sennheiser HD 202 II. I bought these\nmainly to use them when I go for a walk so that I can listen to songs and\nreceive calls. They serve their purpose well...therefore gave 4 stars!  \nComfort level is good. I am typing this review with earphones in my ears, and\nI've been wearing these since past 1.5 hrs. Medium level plugs that were\npresent on earphones as default are good enough for me. Haven't tried small\nand big ones.  \nI take good care of my earphones and that's why my previous ones lasted 3.5\nyears. I don't have high hopes form this Jbl pair though. Let's see!  \nFinally, these are good earphones from a reputed brand for general purpose,\ndon't expect anything special!  \nSpecial Note: These are made in China, its mentioned on box and also on a tag\non earphone wire. So if you have decided to stop buying China manufacturerd\nproducts, stay away regardless of cost, quality, comfort, warranty.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 1 March 2017", "on 9 August 2016", "on 14 October 2017", "on 23 October 2017", "on 19 March 2017", "on 28 January 2017", "on 26 March 2017", "on 10 October 2017", "on 2 October 2017", "on 29 September 2017"], "reviewer": ["Vishal", "M.

Their delivery is loud enough that I didn't even need to surpass the\nvolume past the half mark.  \n2\\. Even after being a bass addict, I had to put the equalizer of my player on\n'balanced'. The bass is so on point that you would be satisfied.  \n3\\. The treble and the vocals are not compromised by the bass. You will even\nbe able to listen to musical instruments/ electronic beats being played that\nyou never did before.  \n4\\. Music can be paused and played by clicking the button once and the track\ncan be skipped by double clicking so dont worry about that. I read, someone in\nthe question / answers had mentioned it doesn't but that's not true. It does\nperform the function of taking and disconnecting calls, needless to say.  \n5\\. The wire is long enough to fit into the trouser pockets without tension\nand is of good rubbery quality. Its not glossy and seems like it won't tangle\neasily. The earphones are light weight as well. Won't fall off during jogging.  \n6\\. The noise cancellation is up to the mark.  \n7\\. The call mic is good as well.  \n8\\. The music seems more pleasant on these whichever genre it may be. I have\nit all, from Queen to Metallica to Ed Sheeran to Marshall Mathers to Coke\nStudio to Gurubaani.  \n9\\. I experienced a little pain in my ears and back of my head after an hour\nof listening songs though. I'd recommend you to use these with intervals.\nThere's another downside of these, it's that the connector (from where the\nwire connects to the aux of earphones) seems weak on the first look.

Good sound quality &\nbass thanks to 9mm drive in headphones. Build quality is also good but wire is\nnot tangle free so it is not for ppl who ll handle it rough . Light weight ,\ncomfortable do come with 3 sizes of ear buds. Due to 9mm drive it bit big and\nfitment in ear could be the issue. One button mic to attend calls and control\nmusic ll comes in handy .\n\n", "My iPhone\u2019s earphone accedentally got damaged. So I was confused whether I\nshould go for iPhone\u2019s earphone again(need high amount for this) or I should\ngo for other than iPhone\u2019s earphone. I decided for JBL after lots of R&D.\nAfter using iPhone\u2019s earphone I thought JBL won\u2019t match its level but believe\nme it does. Not exactly same but it\u2019s quite close.  \nIt has high powerful bass, clear mic sound quality, perfect for iPhone\ndevices.  \n  \nCons-  \nThe only negative point I can see in this earphone, the mic is placed little\nlower ( little far from mouth), you may have to put little effort while making\ncalls. However I tested by making calls, no issues. You need not to hold mic\nnear your mouth during calls.  \nSo I highly recommend this earphone. I bought this one in just 799/- with 75\ncashback in pay balance. Always grateful for amazing Amazon. Loved it!!!\n\n", "I bought this earphone on Republic day sale in Amazon. Initially I was a bit\nskeptical about the quality of the headphone looking at the price at which it\nis being sold and many negative reviews. But after using this headphone for a\nweek now I will say this is one of the best headphones in this budget.  \n  \nPros:  \n\\- Decent Build Quality.  \n\\- Comes with different earbud sizes.  \n\\- Good bass and balance in sound. Bass does not override the voice, so you\ncan enjoy each musical instrument playing.  \n\\- Silicon earbuds are good and soft.  \n\\- One button Microphone quality is very good. I have used it for conference\ncalls.  \n\\- The button can be used to play, pause, 2 press forward, 3 press reverse,\nanswering and disconnecting calls.  \n\\- I generally use this 3/4 hours in a stretch and no pains in ears. This is\nreally important as many in ear headphones cause pain the ears after long use.  \n\\- I have used sony, senheiser, skullcandy, boat bassheads headphones till\nnow. I would rate the sound quality better in JBL C100SI.  \nCons:  \n\\- Nothing as of now.\n\n", "I got these earphones about 2-3 weeks back. At first the impressions were\npoor, but then I used it for a couple of hours and adjusted the equilizer\naccording to my choice of music and it worked fine.  \nSo in order to get good feel of music you have to set the equilizer. I've set\nthe equilizer to high bass and it does give me good bass.  \nThe wires are not tangle-free, it often gets difficult to untangle the wire.  \n*Note : It has lots of treble, if you're purchasing the product then you need to reduce the treble in equilizer settings.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 25 September 2017", "on 9 January 2017", "on 28 September 2017", "on 25 September 2017", "on 8 October 2017", "on 20 March 2018", "on 3 January 2018", "on 7 December 2017", "on 5 February 2017", "on 8 November 2017"], "reviewer": ["Lalit Dogra", "Omkar Panchal", "Umesh", "Dewoo C.", "Saurabh", "Amazon Customer", "Sathya", "Ram", "Bijay", "Rakkshit"]},

I love\nSennheiser for somethings and somethings for JBL  \n  \nWhat i like in Sennheiser?  \nWhen I play a song, the feelings of the songs i feel every time and when i am\nclose my eyes, i feel the original and beautiful sound of the singer Camila\nCabelo! I feel the voice is playing from the backwards and also note the\ninstrument music, bass frequency, the music and the voice of the singer are\nalways cuter then JBL C100SI! Guys, if you falling love with English or\nEspanyol songs, then go for Sennheiser.  \n  \nWhat i like in JBL?  \nGuys when i listening JBL and Sennheiser at the same time, i note JBL have\nmore sound of instruments and beautiful bass than Sennheiser! If you falling\nfor bass, than go for JBL.  \n  \nBoth are comparable and both are good and JBL have high quality microphone but\nSennheiser haven\u2019t any mic!\n\n", "I've tried Senheiser, JBLT150, and BOAT Nirvana 225 before this headset and\nI've never had such a bad experience.  \n  \n1\\. Build quality: The product feels cheap and the material of the wires feels\nplastic and very weak.  \nThe joints near the earphones and the jack is already in a sorry state and\ncould break any moment without even applying much pressure.  \n  \n2\\. The sound quality was below average. The audio is clear but you don't\nexpect such poor sound quality with an earphone in a price segment of\nRs699-899. My BOAT 225, which costs only 499, has a better sound quality, loud\nand clear with great bass.  \n  \n3\\. I've had an issue where one side of the earphone stopped working even\nafter 2 days of usage. I raised a return request because it was under 15 days\npolicy. What if others are not as lucky as me and their earphone stopped\nworking after 15 days. You don't have JBL after sales service in every part of\nthe country.  \n  \nDON'T BUY THIS EARPHONE. It will not last. And for this price there are a hell\nlot of options out there.\n\n", "Don't buy .. Less sound is coming from one of the two earplugs. You can buy\nskul-candy instead .

The performance is very poor.. With high treble noise.. Zero I say\nzero bass.. It's just like 50\u20b9 head phone we get in Grey market.. Please don't\nbuy expecting it to be a normal good headphone\n\n", "GOOD STUFF  \n1.There are 3 different sizes of ear tips that are included allow you to\nchoose a size that gives you the most comfortable listening experience even\nfor longer listening periods  \n2.it has One-button universal remote with mic,you can use it for Answer and\nmanage your calls effortlessly, with the touch of a button  \n3.Driver Size is 9mm  \n4.Works with both Android and iOS devices  \n5\\.

I would like to say its is not right to blame\nany earphone completely for the sound quality and that too of these world's\ntop brands audio products. The sound production comes with the performance\ncapability of the complete hardware & software package (chipset,audio\nchipset,audio codec and the music player). And these days android phones are\nselling like Hot Kachauris. Its obvious that only few companies concentrate on\nthe sound quality, as they need to concentrate more on CPU,RAM,Camera,Storage\netc.... and that too in a very competitive price.  \n  \nNow about the earphone...  \nIt has more than enough Bass, just tweak the equalizer appropriately. It will\nsatisfy anybody, except those who just want to listen bass like a real\nsubwoofer. for those, i would suggest XB series of Sony or something like\nthat. But that XB comes with the compromise of Mids,Vocals & Highs... and they\nare not good for ears. Believe me...The bass in these JBL is just awsome.  \n  \nFrequency response is a bit low (20Hz-20KHz), but that's ok for this price.\nMany won't even recognise it's effect.  \n  \nYes, Treble is slightly high. But not like Intolerable type. Again you can\ntweak the equalizer. The desired sound is fully achievable.  \n  \nI have tested the earphones on my PC, Lenovo Vibe K5 Note, Lenovo A6000, LYF\nFlame1, Samsung Galaxy Grand Max, Sony MP3 Player, My Roland Octapad SPD-30\nV2.0, And even on my BOSS ME-25. It proved full paisa vasool earphone. The mic\nand its button works fine.  \n  \nFrom my personal experience i would recommend to use Jet Audio as music\nplayer. It is the best audio player for all the platforms. PCs & Smartphones.  \n  \nCons:  \nCable is a bit short. the wire length may fall short from pant's pocket to\nears.  \ncomfort level to me was low. you will feel it's presence after inserting in\nyour ear.  \n  \nBottomLine: At this price range, this is the best one. I found it even better\nthan one of my friend's Sennheiser CX180. And it has a mic and a button for\nvarious functions.\n\n", "HELLO GUYS ...  \n\\----------------------------.  \nBefore Starting With The Review of the .

Just listened in iTunes really awesome\neven with half volume, when gone beyond \u00be volume it would not be nice to hear.  \nNotice cancellation is done purely gud.  \nHope it doesn't disturb u when hearing in a bus or train journey.  \nI noticed that it's very light to handle and also gets tangled very rare even\nwhen we keep in bag, purse, pant pockets. It would be an additional info that\nyou should handle with some extra care to keep it alive atleast for 6 months.  \n  \nDon't bother about the less weight, and need a perfect quality sound from JBL\nin this price range, just buy it now, the Amazon packaging was not that better\nthough the headphone cover was well. Thanks JBL.\n\n", "This small package is pure bliss for your ears.  \nI have been using this for the past 4 months and the experience is just mind-\nblowing.  \nOnce you get addicted to these awesome pair of earbuds you'll find other\nearphones and headphones a bit \"feeka\".  \nInitially the earphones don't sound as good but after a few hours of\n\"breaking-in\" the bass and the punches are really on point!!  \nOne small con is that these tangle easily. And also the wire is thin so it\nseems that they may break easily though it may not be real case.  \nBut at this price point and even much much higher these are best ones I have\nheard in a long long time.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 10 February 2018", "on 9 October 2017", "on 19 December 2017", "on 22 September 2017", "on 3 March 2018", "on 19 August 2016", "on 1 September 2016", "on 27 August 2017", "on 18 December 2017", "on 7 March 2018"], "reviewer": ["Nirzar", "Abhishek Kumar", "Amazon Customer", "Raj Surya", "sabari vijay", "Srijit Chatterjee", "Ishant Gupta", "Pradeep Somu", "Kirubhakaran", "Prakhar"]}
