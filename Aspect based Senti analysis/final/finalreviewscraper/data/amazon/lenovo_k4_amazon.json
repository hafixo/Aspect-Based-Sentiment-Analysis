I am still using it and will soon update my\nexperience.\n\n", "Hi  \nCheck my honest review  \n  \nIn day to day life it's best phone to use. But battery life is issue with\nheavy users, some lag will be seen also by me like keyboard is also hang up.\nAnd phone is giving awesome performance. Camera is pretty good in outdoor\nlighting conditions. Lenovo is doing pretty well with this kind of budget\nphone.  \n  \nThis much features with price of 14000 is absolutely acceptable.  \n  \nI am quite satisfied with phone.\n\n", "Overall phone is good, but Camera quality is worst.  \n8 megapixel Camera is just better than Lenovo ki Note\n\n", "This is the honest review I m giving after using this phone for 2-3 weeks,\nfirst of all , let's talk about camera the depth enabled mode(dual camera)\ndoesn't meets my expectations, and results of back camera is ok ok let's say\nonly good ! Nothing special but very satisfied with the front camera . Even in\nlow light ,it captures good pictures , now the battery life is good (as it's\n4000mah) but sometimes it drains very rapidly even without heavy usage and\nsometimes it drains very slowly even in heavy usage! LoL, let me mention one\nthing that it's rapid charger not fast charger, it takes almost 2hrs to charge\nfrom 0-100 only when ur not connected to any internet network or not using ,,\notherwise it takes more than 4hrs , and this isn't mentioned anywhere that I\nam going to tell u that when u play video with quality 360p or less than that\nor 420p or less than that it looks worst ! Ssly worst !! Other specifications\nare at it's top ! 4gb ram and 64gb rom with 10 core processor it doesn't lag\nat all no matter what u do ! Overall the device is good , near to awesome if\nkeep it's price range in mind ! I suggest u to buy this device if the above\nmentioned cons doesn't matters to you !\n\n", "The best all round performance you can find in this price range.  \nNow for Pros n Cons....  \nEverybody knows the Pros,but let me share the cons which I feel very annoying  \nFirstly the screen- random application gets opened as you speak over the phn,I\nmean the screen responds to even ear touch,inspite the proximity sensor\nworking just fine.  \nSecondly the dual camera...USE IT ONLY DURING DAYLIGHT....The camera performs\nmisserably under low-light conditions,More over there is no stabilization on\noffer,getting good photos out of this...Hmmm u just have to depend on nature.  \nWell I guess both these cons can be solved by an update.  \nSo just deducted a star.\n\n", "Not very satisfied with it, it just capture some good images, apart that\nnothing is good in this phone..sometimes lags too much, msgs just gone\ndisppear for while, sometimes doesnt show the contact Name, sometimes doesnt\nopen the required app..before this phone. i was using Lenovo P2, i thought,\nlenovo has upgraded this phn with some extraordinary apps, but this phone\ndissapointed me..\n\n", "HD display, along with free cover, deca core, 4gb ram, dual camera, selfie\nflash, separate sd card slot along with dual SIM and of course 5.5 inches...\nComplete package in this cost.\n\n", "It is a good phone.Works fine.Display is sharp.Speakers are loud and\nclear.Camera quality is okay,but not everyone is a social media addict.  \nIt is good value for Money.However the phone itself doesnt come with any\nfreebies.There were no headphones.  \nWhat i would like to point out is that the headphone it supports are 3.5mm\njack but not every headphone on the street works on it.I had to search quite a\nbit to get an ideal headphone.It takes a bit of an effort to shove the\nheadphone in,You may feel you are damaging the phone...  \nI would say it is great value for money and a bit more reliable than xiomi.\n\n", "I have been using this phone for 2 days now, so I haven't explored all the\nfeatures of this phone completely as yet.  \n  \nGood Things:  \n1\\. Charging is fast considering this to be a 4000 mAH battery.  \n2\\. Sound quality is good, especially on good quality earphones.  \n  \nNot so good:  \n1\\. This is not a 4G + 4G dual standby phone as mentioned in the description.\nThe SIM you select for your data becomes 4G. The other can best support 3G. So\nif you have Jio SIM and it is not selected for data, then that SIM just\nswitches off.  \n2\\. Stock android will take some time to get used to. Missed apps for Music\nPlayer, Photo Gallery that come pre-bundled with other phones.  \n3\\.

I expexted a lot\non chnaging to a bigger brand name of Lenovo. But the phone is not performed\nas expected.  \nI liked to compare Cool pad cool with k8 note  \nPros.  \nBetter look. Nice to hold  \nComparing to Coolpad cool, Thats all  \n  \nCons  \nNO DIRECT WIFI CASTING TO TV, you need chrome cast to cast or screen sharing.\nThis was totally disappointing.  \n  \nBluetooth connection in car is not so smooth. But the connection from Coolpad\ncool was just superb.  \n  \nDepth sensor of rear camera is not that good comparong to Coolpad cool.  \n  \nI am writing this because if someone said this previously i will never buy\nthis phone.\n\n", "Very nice product at that price value of the money  \nCamera quality is good front facing best for selfie  \nBack camera is little bit confusing between object and background  \nBetry performance is unbeatable  \nFHD Screen  \nVery less processing time  \nOnly the processor is mediatek but it is 10core also for batter  \nAll the things are the best so good\n\n", "There were so many features are missing, where when we compare to other lenovo\nphone.  \nBattery is not much worthy and it is been mentioned 4000 mah but the battery\nback up is too low.there was lot of bugs were seen in one day usage\nitself.Finger print is working fine.  \ncamera is also good and great,  \ndesign of the mobile phone is good.  \na dedicated memory card slot is very good and we can use both sim and a memory\ncard. that one of the biggest advantage in this  \n  \nIn overall, it is not worthy for 13k mobile, if more features are been added\n,may be it can be worthy for that amount\n\n", "I was using note 5 and had loved it. I used for a year and half, never faced\nany issues in any areas.. based on this I bought note 8, but it's not up to\nthe mark. There are many problems with this phone..  \n  \n1\\. Didn't understand the duel sim technology. If am on a call I don't get\ninternet. It's not compatible.  \n2\\. Within a month charging cable stopped working.  \n3\\. There is no auto call recorder like note 5.  \n4\\. Other things too but I am lazy to write.  \n  \nI was so much fan of lenovo that I bought same for my mom.\n\n", "If you are looking this phone, phone have 10 core MediaTek processor which can\ngive very good performance as compared to a Snapdragon 625 but the camera of\nthis phone is little compromise because it have a dual setup of camera and the\nphoto which is in portrait or depth mode is not quite good as compared to\nportrait mode camera which is having dual camera compare with MI A1 so if you\nwant good performance in games and some dual portrait mode photos you can buy\nthis phone in very good price\n\n", "Loved it .  \n  \nHands a few times while playing games. But that's ok (I can live with it)  \n  \nSpeakers could have been a wee bit louder, but I normally use Bluetooth\nheadphones, so it really doesn't matter.  \n  \nThe stock OS , was not very pleasing to the eyes nor was it mouldable. So I\nhad to overlay third party launcher. And now I'm quite happy.\n\n", "The features are excellent but the usability isn't there. Despite a 10-core\nprocessor, 4 GB of RAM, it hangs out quite frequently. I have an old Huawei\nHonor 6, 3 GB RAM - 2015 model, which is better than the new device. Also\napplications keeps on crashing quite frequently.  \n  \nCamera is of not good use too. The pixel clarity is inefficient as it gets\nblur upon zooming (after clicking of photographs). Also the time taken for\nsaving the picture is +3 seconds after the click, which is quite high as I\nhave never used such a slow camera in any phone.  \n  \nBattery life is good. With constant data, frequent calling and mail checks, it\nruns for 8-10 hrs. Also turbo charger is a great advantage.  \n  \nSpeakers are another strong point in the phone. The sounds are great, means\ncomparable or better than my Vaio Laptop.  \n  \nThe phone boosts of Gorilla Glass, but got scratch within a week of use while\nkeeping it in pocket only.  \n  \nLenovo doesn't have any Gallery or Music Player apps, so had to download it\nfrom google play, which again either comes with advertisements or I need to\npurchase those. Hence, I am stuck with the advertised versions of basic apps.\nAlso, had purchased New System Updates, still had to update 2 GB of updates in\ntotal 3 times. Still Oreo update would be available only in June/July.  \n  \nThe worst part is I had gifted it to my wife, and now what I got in return is\nthe complaints part, that too all the time. Means despite spending 10k\napprox., this device does not fulfil its advertised words.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 7 September 2017", "on 19 March 2018", "on 17 September 2017", "on 28 February 2018", "on 22 October 2017", "on 26 October 2017", "on 23 February 2018", "on 11 November 2017", "on 28 November 2017", "on 23 February 2018"], "reviewer": ["Gururaju.Y", "mustafa", "Manish Pandit", "Jojan", "Rohit rajput", "Lokesh Bala", "Kumar A.", "Hema", "Christopher Pereira", "Anuj Wadhwa"]}
