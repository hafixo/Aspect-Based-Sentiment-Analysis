Need some improvements on feature\nin phone\n\n", "I have this phone (bought from fk, used for 6 months now). Absolutely amazing\nphone, best I've ever had. Processor is fast for daily use, apps install\nreally quickly and have no hang whatsoever. Camera is stunning (especially the\nblur effect). The photos might be slightly unsaturated compared to LG phones\netc, but I like it that way. The battery life isn't superb and will last for\nhalf a day with extensive use, but it charges fully in 1 hour. Call quality is\nreally good too with no disconnect or dropping. What's also useful is the\nrelease of regular patches by Google to resolve bugs that might have been\noverlooked.  \nMake sure you get an insurance for this though, as repairing it after water\ndamage etc is really expensive.\n\n", "Excelent phone from Mi.
