The build quality is also good. The\nTV is also quite thin comparable to best brands.  \nBefore this tv I was using 40\" Samsung Series 5 LED Smart tv. Compared to that\nthis TCL TV is better in every department- display, sound and aesthetics. My\nonly rue is that the tv protrudes from the wall a little bit more!!!  \nThe TV GUI is nice and lag free. The remote works like a charm.  \nThe TV seamlessly connects to WIFI and wireless keyboard.  \nAbout service I must commend TCL, I received the call withing 2 hrs of TV\nreceipt and the installation was done within few hours. Also, the installation\nguy was very good mannered and he even offered to cleanup the place after\ndrilling which I humbly refused.  \n  \nNow the cons- The things if improved can make the TV really awesome  \nThe SMART TV apps don't work - Amazon Prime videos doesn't work.  \nAlso, HOTSTAR cannot be installed. I called up customer support but the person\ncould only tell me that the tv doesn't support these apps. I don't understand\none thing, why this tv launched only few months back can't support some\nandroid apps???  \nThe other thing is that there is absolutely no manual. The user manual\nsupplied with the product is good for nothing. Hey 'TCL People' nowadays\ndocumentation is a must for any good product. There is not even any\ndownloadable manual on there website.  \nTill date I am unable to understand all the functions of keys of the remote\ncontrol. Only way to find out is try and error.  \nAnother biggest miss their lack of attention. The remote comes with a\ndedicated 'NETFLIX' button but there is no NETFLIX app installed.  \n  \nVerdict: Its a value for money tv.  \nBut it could have been a terrific product had they paid little bit more\nattention.  \nUpdate: It's been more than two months since I purchased this TV. I am totally\nsatisfied with the product. Yes few of the apps don't work properly. But the\nbest idea is to pair it up with Amazon firestick!!! and I have done it.\n\n", "I bought this product with great expectations of a smart TV at a great price.\nThe problem is that while this TV works fine normally it isn't very smart, the\nbasic thing you want to do on a smart TV is use Netflix and Hotstar but those\ndon't work on this TV. There is no Netflix app and you can't even download one\nfrom their app store which only has useless apps. Even if you put Netflix on\nyour phone and cast it to the TV it doesn't work. You can't use Chromecast or\nAmazon Firestick either, both of which are incompatible with this TV. Just to\nmake sure I wasn't doing anything wrong I called TCL and sure enough they told\nme that Netflix does not work on their \"smart\" TV and Chromecast etc also\nwon't work. The amazing thing is that they have put a dedicated \"Netflix\"\nbutton on their remote, see photo. That button does absolutely nothing. This\nis an absolute scam because there is absolutely no way to watch Netflix on\nthis TV. Neither Hotstar or any other video streaming services. You can watch\nYouTube, that's it. So while this TV connects to the internet it's pretty much\nuseless as you can't watch your favorite online shows on it. A better option\nis to buy a non smart TV where you can at least use Chromecast or Firestick.  \nSo please do not get taken in by TCL claims...this TV sucks!\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 12 May 2017", "on 2 October 2017", "on 10 February 2018", "on 28 December 2017", "on 17 February 2018", "on 18 August 2017", "on 10 July 2017", "on 6 February 2018", "on 1 July 2017", "on 5 August 2017"], "reviewer": ["Mahendra Alornekar", "Navneet Juneja", "ravo", "Amazon Customer", "avinash5515", "Senthil Kumar P R S", "Ashish_Raj5000", "Basanti Panda", "Sandeep Kumar", "Amazon Customer"]},

It has 3 HDMI and 2 USB ports. Support bluetooth for audio and has a\nheadphone jack as well.  \nBuilt quality is good and very thing bezels.  \nWhen you power it on and TCL logo appears you can notice some back light\nbleeding from edges of Television which is not good. However it can be ignored\nas its only visible when there is nothing on display.  \nThe remote is quite responsive and connects using Bluetooth, NO need to plug\nin any dongles as remote gets detected automatically.  \nTyping using Remote is very difficult and i will recommend connecting a\nwireless keyboard if you type a lot. I have connected a USB mouse which works\nfine.  \n  \nRemote doesn't have a voice search option so youtube, google play store always\ngive error massage when you click on search box as they are looking for a\nvoice input.  \nIf you are buying this TV to stream youtube forget it as preinstalled youtube\napp only streams 1080p on youtube. Also there is no option for changing\nyoutube quality. If you install youtube app from play store it freezes a lot\nand makes TV to restart.  \nIt has a RAM of 1.5GB and internal storage of 8GB, which is certainlt not\nenough for playing games.  \n4k files stores on flash drive and external hard drive work smoothly.  \n  \nAudio is good for a small 10x 15 room, but you have large room and you may\nhave to connect a sound bar, for my small bedroom it was enough.  \n  \nSmart TV functions are below average and we can not except better as its a low\ncost 4k TV. So I would recommend buying an Android TV box or Amazon fire stick\nalong with it if you are looking for a better smart TV experience.  \nPicture quality if great and you will love watching movies on it. It support\nExternal Hard drive and USB flash drives connectivity and you will be able to\nrun movies off it, a word of advice though don't use built in USB player as it\nlacks features. Install MX player from app store and it will detect and play\nany videos from External hard drives and can play any format of video.  \nThe Smart remote app provided by TCL is use less so waste your time with it,\nIt wont work when you will need it.  \nApp run slow and some times it crashes, pressing power button on remote wont\nhelp and you may have to turn off power from wall.  \n  \nFinal verdict: Please make a note that you are buying this TV as you wanted a\ntrusted brand and a low cost 4K TV, atleast I was.  \nSo I had my expectations within line and I was not dissapointed, I have screen\nwhich has a top notch resolution, great audio and some below average smart TV\nfeatures.  \nI need better smart TV features and instead of buying a rs. 1 lankh TV from\nsamsung or LG I will buy a Smart TV box from Xiomi or get a roku player.  \nI am giving it a 4 Star for its low cost, warranty and below average smart TV\nfeatures.\n\n", "TV is ok for the price but doesn't have much features for being a smart TV.\nThe app store in it has very less apps..no chrome and I had a lot of issues\nconnecting my phones to the TV using the built in cast and also tried the WiFi\ncast..the WiFi cast works but freezes everytime after a few minutes when\nyou're trying to view videos through your phone and the nscreen doesn't\nwork..the built quality of the product is good and the pixels for it being a\n4k is average but not great.

Very slim design and\nlooks beautiful in golden color. The picture quality is amazing. I strongly\nrecommend to buy this product.\n\n", "*********Before you purchase the TCL TV please read my experience today as you\nare going to spend money from your pocket*****  \nHello Everyone,  \nI'm from Pune. I was planning to purchase a big screen LED just like most of\nyou.  \nLooking for affordable TV, I was checking with TCL as an option.  \nBut when I checked the reviews on the product from other I doubted for the\nservice from TCL.  \n  \nThat's why before purchasing the product I contacted TCL support where my call\nwas never been answered and call dropped more than 10 time while in the queue.  \nLater I just googled if there are any service centers in Pune from TCL where\nthe picture was more clear to me.  \nIf you check the official site for TCL India , you will not find any accurate\ninformation on the service centers.  \nWhich directly indicated me that I'm not going to get a quick service in Pune\natleast.  \n  \nLater I found some results for TCL service centers on the google search, where\nfew of the numbers appeared.Check the pictures attached.  \nI called every number that has been listed, and that's where it was a HORRIBLE\nEXPERIENCE.  \nI asked if I'm speaking to the authorized service center from TCL? The person\nreplied YES  \nLater the receptionist/support person asked me a question: Is your TV under\nwarranty? To which I replied YES just to cross check  \nThen she told me that they only repair TV which is NOT under warranty and is\nprivately charged.  \n  \nSo this was my experience with looking for TCL support today. From this\nindications were very clear to me  \nIf I had purchased the TCL and for any reason I had any issues, there was no\ndirect support  \n  \nFrom other reviews where they say : you get for what you are paying  \nI understand comparing to others TCL is more affordable and to some extent we\nare already compromising on the quality that we are getting  \nBut as a customer what was missing for me : is a service and assurance of\nhelping you in something goes wrong  \n  \nSo before you purchase this TV , please cross check if you will get service\nfrom TCl at your location and then come to a decision.  \n  \nAfter spending an entire day looking for trust for TCL I ended up finding\nnothig.  \nHope this helps you and also my words reach TCL management.  \n  \nThanks.\n\n", "Bought the TCL 43 inch L43P2US during the recent Amazon sale around 15th\nAugust , 2017. Received the product in perfect time and no hassles with\nDelivery. Used the TV for 3 days but was forced to return it as it fell short\nof my expectations which I have listed below.  \nPROS:  \n\\+ Screen is extremely crisp specially when playing 4K content.  \nTCL 109.3 cm (43 inches) L43P2US 4K UHD LED TV (Golden)  \n\\+ Sound quality is good but the TV has down firing speakers and I would have\npreferred front firing speakers as the sound travels better (this seem to be\nthe norm with all LED TV's nowadays).  \n  \n\\+ Connectivity options are very good with 3 HDMI ports , 2 USB ports , 1\nNetwork port along with all the other standard connections.  \n  \n\\+ The Bronze / Gold colour of the bezel is a good change from the regular\nblack colour as it gives a premium look to the TV.  \n  \nCONS:  \n\\- The standby light is white colour and is quite bright. It is disturbing\nwhile sleeping specially if you are sensitive to light. There should be an\noption in the menu to either turn off this standby light or make it dimmer. By\ntrying to make the TV look fancy , I see this as a design flaw by the TCL\ndesign team. I must point out that this is in all latest TCL LED , even the\n32inch model.  \n\\- Even though the TV has 3 HDMI ports , not a single port is with HDMI-CEC or\nARC. For those who are not aware , this feature is a industry standard for the\npast 4-5 years. It is used to control the TV volume , power Off / On from a\nsingle remote of a third party Media box like the Apple TV or ROKU Streaming\nBOX through the connected HDMI port. This was the biggest factor for me as\nusing two remotes is inconvenient.  \n  \n\\- The screen is crisp and clear but you can see SLIGHT bleeding on the\ncorners near the bezel if you watch it in a dark room and there is a dark\nscene (Not very noticeable though).  \n  \n\\- The remote control is quite thin but its too long and not the most\ncomfortable to hold and operate specially in a Dark room where you can't see\nthe buttons. Also, the IR could have been better as it has to be pointed\ndirectly at the TV to work.  \n  \n\\- Incase of electricity failure , the screen does not turn back on\nautomatically and goes into standby mode. You need to use the remote to power\nit on again. This can be quite annoying if you live in a city where\nelectricity goes often and specially while watching a movie when the remote is\nnot right next to you.  \n  \nOverall this product is value for money if it's purchased below Rs 32,000 - Rs\n33,000 and if you don't care about the technical flaws which I have mentioned\nabove. I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars.\n\n", "Was expecting delivery on 22nd September but delivered on Oct 4th. Had\nproblems from the day one (1) Does not support Amazon prime. (2) Majority of\nthe Android apps neither work nor compatible (3) Randomly powering off (4)\nlosing network connection frequently. Note that router is 6ft away in the same\nroom (5) TCL technician diagnosed defective MCP Board  \n  \nTCL customer service is worst. When I called, typical answer is someone from\ntechnical team will call you back. After four attempts, as Amazon customer\nservice reprentative mentioned insisted for a Service Request Number.\nSurprisingly, TCL agent does not have any earlier calls noted. I had to argue\nto get one. Amazon wanted to worksheet from TCL technician but they do not\ngive you a copy. I had call their supervisor to get a photo of the work sheet.  \n  \nAll in all, terrible experience from TCL and Amazon did not live up to the\nBrand promise too.\n\n", "Bought Tv for 31090. It was delivered on the second day from the order day.\nBut the technician came to the house after two weeks upon multiple calls and\nescalations with the customer care. Though standard wall mount bracket is\nfree, i opted for movable wall mount with the technician and bought for 1200.\nI hav got the free bracket as well.  \nIts been a month since i started using it. I use sun direct to watch the\nchannels. Builtin WiFi used to connect to my home router to watch YouTube\nvideos. The quality of videos is excellent and ultra HD makes it best. There\nare few default apps that can't be uninstalled. Default app store has veryless\napps to install. Hence i installed play store from that app store and\ninstalled few apps like dolphin browser, antimalware, mx player, etc. But many\napps are not compatible such as chrome, firefox and amazon prime app kills\nitself when i tried to play video. When I tried to play it using dolphin or\nother browsers it didn't work as it works in latest chrome. Online streaming\nin browser and YouTube worked perfectly well. I used Tcast default app to open\nimages, videos directly from mobile to see in TV and it was great. I used HDMI\nport to forcast laptop screen in TV and no issues with it. The sound quality\nis not so loud but decent. I used to connect my F&D home theatre using Aux AV\nout in TV and experienced better sound.\n\n", "\n\n\u00a0Writing my second review after 8 days usage.  \n  \n1) Delivery:  \nBooked 27th june. Expected delivery mentioned as 3rd july. But package\ndelivered on 30th june. Awsome amazon.  \n  \n2) TCL TV:  \n  \nPros:  \n\ud83d\udd18 picture clarity and colour reproduction is first class. Hollywood HD movies\nsync best in this TV display.  \n\ud83d\udd18I watched a real 4k video and oh my god such an awsome clarity like seeing a\nhigh resolution digital photo. Worth a lot for this price tag.  \n\ud83d\udd18sound reproduction was good. Note that you have to manually change sound\nsettings to get that good volume.  \n  \nInternet and smart features:  \n\ud83d\udd18My area has poor internet connection. So i used my mobile's wifi hotspot and\nconnected tv to internet.  \nNote that, signal strength will be good in a particular spot inside my house.\nSo i kept my mobile there. Distance from mobile to TV is almost 10 mtrs. 4G\nsignal so speed was around 3-5mbps.  \nNow I watched Baahubali full hd video song via YouTube. Buffering perfectly\nwithout any lag. This shows tv's wireless signal capturing strength was\nawsome.  \n\ud83d\udd18youtube videos also gave same superb resolution.  \n\ud83d\udd18almost some important apps are available in app store. If not there then we\ncan get google play store from tcl app store. Then via google play store we\ncan get all android apps.  \n  \nCons:  \n\ud83d\udd18 eyes are irritating Watching continuously. Does it was default for all led\ntv's?  \n\ud83d\udd18TV is Earthing on the right side back. I felt very minor current. Did my\ncurrnt line was fault or TV I don't know.  \n\ud83d\udd18some video formats are not playing by default. But after installing mxplayer\nit got resolved. So not a big problem.  \n\ud83d\udd18TV's outer materials not looking that durable. Still ok. Anyways what shall\nwe expect for 30k price tag?  \n\ud83d\udd18No alphabet keys in remote. So searching option is a hectic one.  \n  \n3) Service:  \nI saw many people complaining service. I guess that depends on the location\nyou are. I am from chennai. Within 1hr from the product got delivered, I\nrecieved call from TCL service centre for installation on the same day. This\nshows that service center is well responsive in my Chennai location.  \n  \nNote:  \n\u25ab\ufe0fConsider your room size before buying 43inch TV. My room size was medium and\nTV looks very big so watching pictures from distance also looks very near. I\nbelieve that is the reason eyes are irritating.  \n\u25ab\ufe0fI use tata sky and its hd channels are syncing perfectly with tcl 4k\ndisplay.  \n  \nOverall, for a price tag of 32k, this TV means a lot comparing to others in\nmarket. In that aspect, we can say it is worth buying.\n\n", "It is a true 4k smart TV with android 5.1.1 installed, 6gb internal memory,\nwith Wifi and Bluetooth.  \nPicture and sound quality is excellent.  \nEasy to use, all types of connectivity support such as USB 2.0, USB 3.0, HDMI\n1.4, HDMI 2.0, RGB, 3.5 mm audio input, VGA, Ethernet etc.  \nSupports T-cast mobile app to connect your smart phone to use it as a remote\nor to cast content from your mobile. Mobile touch screen can be used as a\nmouse pointer for this TV.  \nI was able to connect my dualshock 4 controller to it via Bluetooth to be used\nas a remote control for the TV and the games in it. I ran real racing 3 on it\nusing Dualshock 4 and it was a great experience.  \nIt also connects to your PC via VGA or HDMI 2.0 cable (for 4k @60fps). As a\nhardcore gamer myself I tested many games on it such as GTA 5, Nier Automata,\nRocket league, Batman Arkham Knight, Street fighter V, Mortal Kombat XL, Dead\nor alive 5 last round and it functions almost identical to a 4k monitor at\n60fps. The 6ms input lag is very forgivable for a TV in terms of gaming,\nactually better than most TVs I've seen before.  \nMy final verdict is, this TV is a true masterpiece for it's price. I bought it\nfor Rs. 25k on sale but it's an\u200b absolute value for money even for Rs. 32k.  \nThanks to TCL and Amazon for this amazing product. I'm am truly satisfied with\nit.  \nPeace... \ud83d\ude03\u270c\n\n", "If you are looking for the quality of the TV, honestly I don't know  \nI waited for installation for 12 days and finally returned the TV unopened. If\nthey can't install a TV in 12 days after multiple promises, how can I trust\nthem to commit to the warranty service provided by them? All other brands are\nperforming next day installations while TCL is just toying with customers\neveryday saying \"It will be done today\". Mind you, this was after multiple\nfollow up calls and escalations from amazon and myself.  \n  \nExtremely bad service from TCL!  \n  \nEdit:  \nLook at the comment by TCL on this review: \"As per our telephonic discussion\nwe will arrange technical visit today to resolve the issue\" This comment comes\nunder a clear review stating I returned the TV. They called me after 3 more\ndays of returning the TV(15 days since buying), saying installation will be\ndone today. I was surprised and told them I returned the TV. Then I realized\nthat they did the call only to be able to write this comment under this\nreview. They just want to negate the effect of negative reviews on amazon by\nwriting comments like these.  \n  \nTCL, please learn from Amazon what customer service means! It doesnot mean\ngiving robotic responses to phone calls and giving commitments to customers\nwhich you don't care to deliver.. It doesnot mean writing comments under a\nreview..  \nCustomer satisfaction only comes with delivering on promises.\n\n", "FIRST OF ALL ACCORDING TO THE PRICE POINT THIS TV IS DAMN AWESOME!!!!!!  \nIT REALLY SMOOTHENS THE VIDEO AS WE SEE IN SONY TVS.  \nTHE COLORS ARE REALLY GREAT AND NOT THE OVERSATURATED ONES.  \nJUST GO FOR IT .

The 4K quality is really good.  \n  \n2) Design: Slim design which is very pleasing to eyes.  \n  \n3) Apps: I did not have a high hopes on its price features and I did not\nexpect it as well from a 32K TV, specially after reading negative reviews on\nits smart features but I am able to run Netflix, Youtube, Hotstar. These apps\nare not on app store, you have to download and install the apk on your own.\nHaving said that Amazon Prime Video APK and Voot is not working on this TV.  \n  \nCons  \n  \n1) Poor Configuration: Hardware configuration is very poor, processor and ram\nis not enough to power the software its running on. If you are playing video\non youtube app and you are changing volume at the same time, from TV remote,\nyou may see a lag in the TV's response. Sometimes video and audio are not in\nsync which is again a result of overloading of processor.  \n  \n2) Remote: remote doesn't have airmouse or voice feature.  \n  \n3) Android Version: Android version is old and somehow I am not able to update\ngoogle play service due to which many apps are not running. Voot and many\nother apps run on latest google play service and they display an error message\n\"Please update google play service\" but when you update google play service it\nshow error 504.  \n  \nIn the end I would say its a good buy, I usually watch netflix and hotstar and\nI am not feeling a need to buy mi box or amazon firestick however all these\ncons can be overcome by buying amazon fire stick in just 3-4K.\n\n", "Awesome, Good picture quality & sound. Thanks to Amazon.\n\n", "Product is not good, due to following reasons, 1. WiFi worked for T-Cast\n(mobile to Tv Screen) worked only for 3 days. 2. None of the smart TV features\nare easily accessible / or they are not working (so we can say they are all\neye wash) 3. Price mentioned on the MRP on box is 32,990/- where as they are\nshowing that they are giving great discount is all Lie by Amazon (pls check\nthe MRP on the box its Rs.32,990/-) so there is no discount given as shown in\nthe Amazon. 4. With all this i fine they are dumping Chinese products by\ngiving misleading adds and once you buy you can never return/refund your\nproduct.  \n  \nSo beware before you buy. There is no Onsite warranty also, which means you\ncannot carry the heavy tv to their customer care nor you could get it repaired\neasily.\n\n", "It seems to be perfect at this cost although it is not pure Android experience\nbut anyways it has good picture quality,it plays crisp videos even from your\nUSB pen drive & Hard disks.The stock applications are unuseful and unnecessary\n& we can not delete them.As it is not stock android we can not access latest\nupdates and applications which are available to Android TV as the Google Play\nis locked by TCL to certain extent where user feels limitations and\nhopeless,however you can install the apps which are installed on your\nsmartphone to this TV via an very useful app ES Explorer available on Google\nPlay Store which you can install first on your smartphone and then to your TCL\nTV and remotely install any App you wanted to be install on your TV easily\nover WiFi.Overall good experience on such a budgetary cost for 4K Version and\nsomething is better than nothing you still have some hopes on experiencing\nsome Android apps easily in this TV as it is running on Android 5.1.You can\nalso make it pure android by purchasing the Android Box separately & your TCL\nwill be your pure Android TV..So chill as it costs around 7000INR and can save\nyou money by few thousands rather than purchasing a Android TV which is\ncurrently in few lacs of rupees..The MI android Box is good enough as it\nprovides magic remote and voice command set..so go get it..Anyways it runs You\nTube seamlessly thats it...\n\n", "Not all items are given along with package\n\n", "Worst service by TCL.

I called TCL\nhelpline at 1800 419 0622 on December 6 but the response was pathetic and I\nwas not provided any request number but I was only told that someone will call\nme next day but till now I have not received any call. I have today sent an\nemail to indiasupport@tcl.com and hope to get the required support from TCL.\n\n", "The TV build is good but there's flexing at some places. The interface is\ngreat as long as you don't use the inbuilt apps. The ports section is rock\nsolid. While the display is borderline good, the apps suck. The image clarity\ndepends on the content being offered. If the content is shot in full HD expect\nthe output to be in full HD or else your tv won't do much. Something to\nconsider right. Actually no point buying a 4K tv right now when most of the\ncontent is offered in 420p to 1080p. TV channels are disappointing to watch.\nThe pictures are so grainy. HD channels disappoint but a little less though.\nEven with a high bandwidth internet connection the apps don't load at all. So\nwhat's the point of them being there on the tv. The speakers sound very basic\nbut very natural and very clear. My impressions about this t v are mixed but\nthey tend to be more on the negative side. Will wait for a few more days and\ndo a little more tweaking and then edit this review just in case I find\nsomething more positive to write about. I have purchased this tv. Even though\nI don't regret buying it I now know why some brands sell their TVs at such\nhigh prices.  \n  \nIf you already have already downloaded 1080p videos they do get scaled to 4K.\nThis is only for true 1080p videos not for those converted videos with crap\nsoftware which simply give you an output with a bigger file size and no real\nquality. The reason HD channels look okay and not great is because they are in\n720p is what I'm guessing.  \n  \nNow I find there's uneven back lighting on the screen. There's a shadowy\neffect on a few areas on the screen and then there left side of the screen is\nbrighter than the rest of the panel. At an angle if you check you can make out\nthat the screen isn't fixed properly in place. Have ordered a replacement.\nLet's see how it goes.  \nLet me tell you the apps on this tv are a pain to navigate with the remote. It\nis better to download the tcast app and then try.
