DELIVERY - Thanks Amazon for On time delivery \ud83d\udc4d.  \n  \n2\\. LOOK & FEEL - One word - SMART \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0d. Extra care to be taken though while\nputting the phone on to the surface as rear cameras are bit seeing outside\nfrom the body. Can overcome this by using some decent back. One transparent\nBack cover is provided in the box along with screen guard applied on the phone\nscreen.  \n  \n3\\. PERFORMANCE - Incredible so far. No lag. Played multiple Heavy games like\nAsphalt extreme, Taken, 3D tennis etc and OP5T welcomes and handles them\npretty smooth with no phone heatup observation so far. Oxegen UI - Simplicity\nis the best. I am on Android - 8.0.1; Oxegen OS - 5.0.4.  \n  \n4\\. BATTERY - Awesome so far \ud83d\ude0e. I usually charge in alternate days with avg 5\nhrs screen on time. Dash charging is gr8. Takes approx. 1 Hour to charge from\n2 to 100% (Screen-shot attached).  \n  \n5\\. CAMERA - Great Camera. Not much settings to tweek. But having multiple\nmodes (Pro, photo, slow-mo, selfie, portrait - for Bokeh feature to shoot DSLR\nlike photo which works pretty well). Decent low light photos. Selfie camera is\ndecent. However, couldn't find Bokeh feature in front camera so far. Take a\nlook on the shoots attached.  \n  \n6\\. OTHER FEATURES -  \n\\- Loudspeaker and headphone sound quality is decent.  \n\\- In built call recording feature is good.  \n\\- Extra features are pretty smart  \n\\-- 3 fingers screenshot.  \n\\-- 3 diff display modes (Normal, Night & Reading which make the display B&W\nand can be enabled app wise.)  \n\\-- Multi-tasking while making one app minimise on bottom side of screen just\nlike YouTube videos and look something else on phone.  \n\\-- Game-do not disturb mode.  \n\\-- Face unlock and finger print scanner are super fast.  \n\\-- Taking selfies from finger print point.  \n  \n6\\. OP COMMUNITY APP - Keeps the users up-to-date with the phones updates etc.\nGet instant response from OP team.  \n  \nCONCLUSION - Overall it's worth buying phone indeed comparable to it's other\ncompetitors available in market in this price range !!\n\n", "I just can't find a flaw in this phone, This is literally the phone I was\nlooking for.  \n  \nPros:  \n1) Performance is on par with any flagship phones out there.  \n2) Great AMOLED screen, that has deep blacks and great color reproduction and\nbright enough for usage in direct sunlight.  \n3) 8 GB Ram and 128 GB internal storage is more then enough for making this\nphone a future proof investment. Games like Asphalt Xtreme runs buttery\nsmooth. Running multiple apps hardly pose any challenge to this phone.  \n4) Stock Android with no bloatware is great.  \n5) Battery life is awesome which lasts whole one day with gaming, browsing,\ncalls, chats and streaming videos. Dash charge is extremely fast I got about\n60% within 30 mins.  \n5) Price is just right, bit expensive for this star wars edition but I am cool\nwith it.  \n  \nCons:  \n1) No Oreo update till now.\n\n", "Display of the device is very good battery backup is good as well. performance\nwise phone lag a little bit but due to 6gb ram it's don't catch easily\nspeakers of the phone is loud enough it and what camera one of the assit of\nthe phone portrait mode is aweosme oneplus should give live photo option in\ncamera settings overall i have updated the photo to oreo 8.0 now I'm seeing\nbattery performance of the phone...

But about disappointment from\nfront camera because it won't capture in wide angle.  \nBut overall it's an amazing devise till now experience.\n\n", "Moved from Nexus 6 to One Plus 5T and using this for the last two months. It\nis the best bang for the bucks in the price range. The total 33k it is worth\nin all aspects. People mentioning no IP 67 rating and all should be told that\nit is just the numbers and I recently used it during a speed boat ride where\nit was splashed with waves quite so many times and still it runs damn smooth\nwithout any issues. Those who pick up this device will be very well aware of\nthe specs and that need not be told. Only thing, please buy a good phone case\n(even though it ships with one) as the device is slippery and you dont want to\nsee a cracked 18:9 screen soon after you start enjoying those movies on this\ndevice.\n\n", "This phone has unbelievable speed of charging. It's software is smooth and\nfast and best hardware.  \ncamera is better but rather than nature photo it processes the image and make\nit look beautiful.  \nPhysical appeaance of mobile is way average compared to what we see in\npictures and battery is 3400mah which is one and only drawback of this\nflagship phone.  \nOverall it is best phone to buy but i think it is over priced by around 5k.  \nYou can definitely go for it even if this negative sounding review.\n\n", "I have been using mobile over a month now. As of now per inoovation available\nin market, this has perfect hardware spec and performance. Particularly camera\n3d effect. Amazing! As if DSLR is in hand, love to take pics now.

Recommend to buy this.  \n  \nLooks of phone is slik and attractive in all aspects worth buying in this\nprice.  \n  \n6GB ram is good option given...as now a days market is more on to the software\napplication and need more memory. Looks this performance of phone will long\nlast till many years...and not like other phone hope for the best.  \n  \nThe DEV team OP5 is good for development and reported issues.  \n  \nAmazon is also a good in there delivery and all.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 27 November 2017", "on 29 November 2017", "on 31 January 2018", "on 28 November 2017", "on 15 December 2017", "on 25 January 2018", "on 4 February 2018", "on 5 March 2018", "on 21 December 2017", "on 21 December 2017"], "reviewer": ["Rajeev S Nair", "Ankit Jain", "Amit B.", "Amazon Customer", "Amazon Customer", "praneeth", "Vimal Viswanath", "Akash Amin", "Amazon Customer", "nitin"]},

It's really very useful. Your eyes will not strain that\nmuch. Although you can't compare it with kindle. It's still good.  \n3-Camera  \nI will say it's not like Google Pixel 2 but it still performs pretty good.  \n4- Fast Charging  \nI charge my phone before going to office. I plug in the charger at the time of\ngetting up and the moment i come out after taking bath, the phone fully\ncharges. It charges very fast. In 30 min my phone goes from 50% to 100%.\n\n", "Awesome phone....  \nI felt battery back up also good.

The pictures are\nawesome. Night photography is simply out of the world. With decreased shutter\nspeed and its brilliant algorithm for low light, it produces day like images\nin the night, even under just celestial lighting. Try it to believe it.

In one line this\nphone is value for money in true sense.  \n  \nPros  \n1\\. Processor is super fast & not observed a single lag in 15 days. Even\nrunning faster than my Galaxy S8+ (may be due to clean UI as compared to\nSamsung).  \n2\\. Display is Excellent in this price range. (Should not be compared with\nHigh range phone like Pixel, Galaxy S8 etc.)  \n3\\. Dash Charging is mind boggling Fast. Used so many phone with Fast charging\ncapacity but this one is best.  \n4\\. Battery Back up is decent can run for 1.5 days on single charge with\nmedium usage.  \n5\\. No heating issue even after heavy usage.  \n6\\. Amoled Display notification is cool & look nice.  \n7\\. Rear Camera is superb in daylight condition.  \n8\\. Fingerprint Sensor is fast & surprisingly Face unlock is also super fast.\n(wasn't expected that much accuracy for Face Unlock before buying)  \n9\\. One of the best advantage is OP team listen to their customer for any BUG\nor Feature improvement & provide update frequently.  \n  \nCons.  \n1\\. Potrait mode not available in front camera.  \n2\\. Speaker could have been better in this price.  \n3\\. It should have at least IP67 rating.  \n4\\. One Basic in built music player should be added in Oxygen OS.  \n  \nOverall in this price range my rating for this phone is 9.6 out of 10.  \nThose who are willing to buy a mid range phone which have all the quality of\nFlagship Phone go for it without any 2nd Thought, you will not regret.  \nIf your main priority is Camera & can spend some extra buck should try for\nPixel or Galaxy S8. In this price range you will not get better camera than\nthis in any other phone.\n\n", "Great display, best battery utilization optimization with a very very fast\ncharging..... operating system could be improved a little  \nGood processor, a very good low light back camera, performs good in normal\nlighting as well obviously. Front camera could have been improved and more\nfunctions could have been given in stock camera app though I like use of\nscreen as flash while taking selfies in low light  \nOverall a good phone.  \nGiving 4 stars as I feel the price is a bit on higher side given the chinese\ncompetition in market like Huawei and xiaomi but hey one plus don't reduce\ntheir price over time like them which is a plus in a way\n\n", "Terrific phone. Haven't found anything to grumble in 2 weeks of usage. Battery\nlife is better than peers. heavy usage lasts full day, moderate usage lasts\nalmost 2 days. Dash charge is amazing.\n\n", "After a month of usage i feel oneplus is a real competitor to apple , samsung\nand other conpanies.  \n  \nThe major advantages are -  \n1\\. BATTERY  \nThe one plus 5t has a great battery life. It has dash charge which is i feel\nthe fastest available on market. Within 5 minutes it has around 10 - 15\npercent charge. It also holds up good for games such as asphalt 8 and modern\ncombat 5  \n  \n2\\. CAMERA  \nThe camera is amazing. It can take great portrait pictures . A professional\nphotographer will truly love this phone. Even in darkness the camera works\njust fine  \n  \n3\\. PERFORMANCE  \nThis phone can do amazing multitasking. It can smoothly run 5 - 10 apps\nwithout any lag. This is especially useful if someone uses this phone\ncontinuously for hours.  \n  \n4\\. SECURITY  \nThe fingerprint sensor is the fastest I've seen. And the face unlock too is\nvery fast and during emergencies , time will not be wasted on trying to unlock\nthe phone  \n  \n5.DISPLAY  \nAnother mind blowing feature is the display. It is bezel-less and the display\nis truly amazing. The colour contrast is very good  \n  \n6.COST  \nI believe this is the best phone below 50 k and while it may be cheap for what\nit holds, it rivals the power of the galaxy series , the apple phones at half\nthe cost  \n  \nThat being said , no phone is without any disadvantage. However these vary\nfrom person to person . Some which i found with this phone are -  \n1\\. Due to the phones size the fingerprint sensor is a bit hard to reach  \n  \n2.the feel of the phone is a bit different and so adjusting will take a week's\ntime  \n  \nThis phones scores in all areas and i feel this could really change the tide\nin mobile phones in the near future\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 3 December 2017", "on 12 March 2018", "on 10 February 2018", "on 26 January 2018", "on 28 November 2017", "on 2 March 2018", "on 7 March 2018", "on 22 February 2018", "on 7 December 2017", "on 25 February 2018"], "reviewer": ["Kumar R", "Anand Jaiswal", "Anmol Rastogi", "Karthik", "Pankaj Gupta", "Oru Adaar Love Song", "Pritam Jana", "Ankur Gupta", "Anshuman Mohapatra", "Amazon Customer"]},

However, having used this device for almost\ntwo months now, I'm quite happy with it. No annoying battery problems. Almost\n4 hrs of screen time with moderate to heavy use, including healthy doses of\nYouTube, some light gaming, and lots of book reading both on Kindle and Play\nbooks. Also, though Dash charge isn't really a day's power in half an hour :P,\nit does charge the phone pretty quickly. 20 to 95 in an hour or so. The camera\nis still grainy and flat out bleak with low lighting. So much for the extra\nlow light lens. Where it does a good job, is with balancing harsh colours\nunder a streetlight or other evening city lights. Audio quality is noticeably\nbetter than the Two. Using an aux cable with good speakers now actually sounds\nlike good audio.  \n  \nThe delivery and purchase experience was not exactly what I'd expect from\nAmazon, though. The couriers they use routinely do not attempt to contact the\ncustomer before a delivery, and I had to constantly call back the numbers that\nwere leaving me missed calls. Also, opting for a delivery window has no\neffect, as the delivery will be made as per the courier's convenience. Too bad\nif you have office and would like a delivery at home. :(  \n  \nOverall, I'm satisfied with how this device turned out.\n\n", "Adding to the bulk of positive reviews, I would say just this: It is a beast.\nSwitched over from the original OnePlus One, having used the 3T in between for\n2 months before it got stolen, I must admit, the 5T is in a category of its\nown. It never overheats. Never lags. Produces great photographs in almost any\nlight. has the perfect feel in the hand. charges, well, blazing fast. I was\nwondering if I should wait for the OnePlus 6 or not, but apart from Oreo, I\ndon't think this phone misses anything big. IR Blaster? Who uses it. Memory\ncard slot? Yes, but it has OTG which is enough for me. Missing a 2k display\nthat I hope the OP6 has, but I can just use someone else's phone for VR, and I\nhaven't started making VR films yet.  \n  \nP.S. Rooted it after the first boot. A super smooth process as expected,\nwaiting for a more stable Oreo build for now. The developer community seems\ngreat. There are so many great Custom ROMs available, but the stock ROM is so\ngood in itself with so many neat features, that Custom ROMs are literally not\neven needed, especially with Stable Oreo coming out soon. This literally feels\nlike a revival of the Nexus line. Cheers!\n\n", "Awesome phone. Had issues with the first order. Amazon was prompt in replacing\nthe mobile. New phone reached me within 3 days.  \nPros and cons have already been discussed by other customers, but I am totally\nhappy with the product.\n\n", "This review is based on performance of phone after use of 1 month...\nEverything else is fine except call connectivity. From last 3 days the problem\nis increased... Every cal gets disconnected or I can't here a single word of\ncaller without getting muted. My network provider said it's clearly mobile\nsignal reception problem\n\n", "\\- Brilliant battery life - I am a heavy user and I end the day at 20% with\nOP5T. I ahve used Android flagshps in the past - htc one, nexus 6p, oneplus 3\nbut noone came close to this experience.  \n\\- Dash charging is briiliant meaning I just need to charge my phone for 45\nmins everyday and Im set for the entire day  \n\\- Good screen - the thin bezels are really attractive and the lack of qHD is\nnot visible at all  \n\\- Fast! - no lags, just butter-smooth experience.  \n\\- Camera - pretty decent although not as good as pixel2/s8/iphone/v30  \nGo for it!\n\n", "I am beyond happy with this buy. If the thousand+ positive feedback/reviews do\nnot convince you to buy this monster, I don't know what will.  \n  \nYes, the hype is real.  \nYes, the reviews are legit.  \nYes, this phone is badass.\n\n", "I just love it!  \nThe performance is simply awesome. This phone is crazy fast.  \nThe AnTuTu benchmark score is 208809  \nCamera is good and it's better than Iphone. Can't compare it with Sony\nflagship phones even though it has got Sony lens.  \nFastest Face recognition ever  \nBattery life is awesome  \nDash charging is simply great!  \nThis phone never ever slows down on heavy usage and there is no heating issue.  \n  \nCheck out for protection cover in Dbrand India. It's awesome, you can\ncustomize the back cover as you wish.\n\n", "The OnePlus 5T is clearly a winner in all aspects.  \nI've been getting consistent 26-30hr battery performance (Location permanently\nset to high accuracy, switching between 4G and WiFi, medium to heavy usage),\nthe screen looks great and performance is on par with the flagships(if not\nbetter).  \nThe camera could be better but is good enough for everyday shots.  \nIt's a clear, reliable and stylish choice for people looking for high end\nperformance at an affordable price.\n\n", "I have been using this phone since a month. I am personally completely\nsatisfied with the phone in all aspects.  \n  \nEarlier I was using OnePlus 2. With this new phone I feel I got upgraded in\nall respects.  \n  \nMy observations: (will compare with my earlier phone so that we can understand\nthe improvements in this phone)  \n1\\. Face unlock is awesome. (I sweat a lot and so was not able to use\nfingerprint on my OP2. Now that problem is solved. Fingerprint is also better\nthan earlier)  \n2\\. It charges 100% in 1 hour with dash charge. Without dash charge it\ncharges, 1% in 1min. Dash charge is provided with the package. OP2 didn't have\nfast charge.  \n3\\. The phone comes with a screen guard and there is also a bumper case with\nin the box. Except for the headphones, everything is available in the box. OP2\ndidn't have either of them.  \n4\\. Upgradable to Oreo which gave lot of new features like separate work\nprofile to differentiate your personal and office things. Even you can have\ndifferent credentials of fingerprint and face for work profile so that all\nyour personal things you can give access to your family members and can keep\nyour office things private.  \nAndroid is also very close to stock Android and there is no clutter what so\never.  \n5\\. 6GB of RAM, didn't close a single app till now since 20 days.  \n6\\. I personally don't take too much of photos, but camera is very good\ncompared to OP2 especially low light photos.  \n7\\. Battery comes almost for 2 days on single charge. 1 hour of charging and 2\ndays of use. Just awesome. I use my phone almost 3 hours a day.  \n8\\. Screen is bigger now with HD+ screen. They seem to have designed a font\nfor the phone, which is unique. They also have an option on English (India)\nduring phone first setup which I liked. Till now we always have to select\neither English(US) or English (UK).  \n9\\. One more important point everybody has to consider while buying this phone\nis that the price of the phone will not drop whatsoever till the phone goes\nout of stock or a successor is available. Apple, Samsung, Pixel phone prices\ndrop over a period of time.  \n  \nOverall it is a value for money phone if you can afford.  \nClose to stock Android OS with OP2 promise of flagship like performance. You\njust can't beat this phone in value for money category.  \n  \nIt may not be a beast compared to iPhone and Samsung high end phones, but for\na heavy user this is the best phone.  \n  \nFew Drawbacks that some people may consider before buying:  \n1\\. Size of the phone is big, even for my big hands, single hand operation is\ndifficult. (It has 6.01 inch screen)  \n2\\. No memory card expansion slot (I personally don't consider this as a\ndisadvantage).  \n3\\. No waterproofing. Phone is costly, and over a period of all of us are\nusing phones everywhere in several conditions. Waterproofing should have been\nconsidered.  \n4\\. If you put the bumper case provided by OnePlus, you cannot see the OnePlus\nsymbol at all. So, no way people will understand which brand phone is it. Not\na big disadvantage, but a proud user would like to showoff the brand name.\nApple does it best w.r.t symbol legibility to the outside world.  \n  \nAdded camera samples in low light conditions and indoor conditions.\n\n", "Guys, I've been using this phone for almost a month now. Must tell you that\nyou won't find any better phone in this price range atleast. Best part is the\ncamera & dash charging battery. Battery never seems to dry up though it's just\napprox 3300 mAh. No overheating, no hanging & no irritating stuff...if you are\nlooking to buy a phone in this price range, just close your eyes & go for\nit...you won't be disappointed.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 26 January 2018", "on 26 January 2018", "on 14 January 2018", "on 17 March 2018", "on 15 December 2017", "on 3 January 2018", "on 18 March 2018", "on 1 January 2018", "on 23 March 2018", "on 20 March 2018"], "reviewer": ["Akash K, New Delhi", "harsh doshi", "Mahesh", "Rushikesh", "Karan Kumar", "Jane", "VJ", "Siddhant Sawhney", "Kartik Podugu", "Rohit Sharma"]},
