I've had matte ones, and all sorts. These actually feel really nice, and\nare easy to apply. They come in a nice compressed wood box along with\nauxiliary tools to help in the application.  \nIt's a nice touch for those who want to be as thorough as possible in getting\nthat perfect application of the screen, but I didn't use all of them. Even\nwithout doing so, the screen lays on the phone easily and smoothly to where it\ngets the air out towards the edges for no air pockets. The best I like about\nthe product is that it is, and feels like glass.  \nMost smart-phones today have Gorilla Glass or some other scratch-resistant\nscreen. I always prefer tempered glass screen protector for my smart-phone\nwhich protect it from scratches and screen broken. Good feeling.  \nSome protectors can have that plastic-like feel to it, but this is smooth and\nsturdy tempered glass. I would certainly recommend this to someone looking for\na screen protector, and what's nice is that they make more for other various\nproducts.  \n  \n:.....iTs Usage.....:  \n\\- Its main usage is protect our smartphones display, once gets stroked, get\nthe new piece.  \n  \n:.....Tips and Tricks.....:  \n\\- Any uncertain strike would affect the tempered but not the stock display.  \n\\- While applying use all the given tools over the perfect fit.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------  \n\ud83d\udce5 Box Contents -  \n\\-----------------------------------  \n  \n\\- A tempered glass.  \n\\- Applying kit.  \n\\- Wiping kit.  \n\\- Sturdy box.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------  \n\ud83d\udc4d Lets see the Pros?  \n\\-----------------------------------  \n  \n\\- Has got an accurate curves.  \n\\- Cut-outs were perfect-  \n\\- An actual fit.  \n\\- Mainly suitable for OnePlus X.  \n\\- A quality piece.  \n\\- Packaging was good.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------  \n\ud83d\udc4e What would be the Cons?  \n\\-----------------------------------  \n  \n\\- As per with the curves, I thinks the more curved at up-to 5D would be\nbetter. But, for the price what you get is enough.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------  \n\ud83d\udde8 Verdict -  \n\\-----------------------------------  \n  \nOverall I feel that this tempered glass is a sturdy product, but as of with\nthe curves I think it would be better as it featured with 5D technology. As of\nin the quality department it stood nice over by the budget segment as well.  \n  \nWas my review helpful to you?
