While many of the mixers I looked at had\ntwo jars for grinding and one big jar which can be used only for blending, all\nthree jars of this mixer can be used for wet grinding. I have a Prestige mixer\nand its blender jar can be used only for whipping milk shakes or things like\nthat. I could not even puree tomatoes for juice. The large jar in this Preethi\nmixer is good enough for wet grinding, which is perfect for me. The medium jar\nis somewhat small, but I spoke to the Preethi service centre and they had a 1\nLt jar which I bought. Then this becomes the perfect mixer. Prompt and\nefficient delivery by Amazon. Preethi service is excellent. The small jar was\ndefective .The lid did not close properly. Took it to the service centre with\nthe bill and warranty card and they replaced the SS part of it.\n\n", "Worth buying.

How can I get it exchanged..\n\n", "I have been using preethi ecochef plus since last 7 years. It wasn't perfect.\nI had to repair the Bush of the mixie every 4 months. After a while I bought\nextra and put them handy because when you use it for more than 10 minutes it\nwould heat up and the Bush would melt. Also the sound was horrible. It got too\nloud and I bought this new version of blue leaf. Now I feel the eco chef was\nmuch better than this. The coriander seeds aren't becoming a fine powder.. You\ncannot make Vada batter in it, the smallest jar lid is too tight, once you\nclose it you can't open it. I don't use the smallest jar anymore. I would\nnever buy a preethi mixie ever again.\n\n", "Writing this review after one week of use. Performs as expected. Blades are\nsharp and grind well quickly. Jars fix well in place and easy to remove also.\nThe base strongly sticks to surface and hence does not move while applying\ntwist force to remove the jar. Do not try to lift the base all at once. It\nwill be hard. Lift one leg at a time, it will come up easily.  \n  \nThe noise level is as per spec. It is not a low noise grinder and the\nmanufacturer never claims the same. The only issue is there seems to be jerk\nwhen the blades start rotate from zero speed. Not sure whether it is expected.\nThe other mixer that we have does not have this jerk feeling. Hopefully its\nnot an issue.\n\n", "Till now product has worked ok and i hope it works like that in coming days\nalso.

Highly recommended.\n\n", "Had great expectations on the product. The blades are fixed and almost touch\nthe bottom of the jar hence even small pieces of tomato remain in pieces.\nQuality is poor. The lid of the chutney jar gets tight once you grind chutney\nand is impossible to open. Nothing beats my good old panasonic mixer. The\nquality and performance is excellent compared to this mixer.\n\n", "After use of one week. Powerful and not too noisy. Item was not handed over\ndirectly to us, instead handed over to security guard without informing us.\nAmazon please make sure the delivery persons to call and get confirmation\nbefore handing over to security guard of the apartment.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 2 January 2018", "on 26 August 2017", "on 1 May 2017", "on 11 October 2017", "on 13 August 2017", "on 25 May 2017", "on 13 November 2017", "on 3 January 2018", "on 16 January 2018", "on 19 October 2017"], "reviewer": ["Amazon Customer", "partha", "Amazon Customer", "DB", "Dinesh", "sakardem", "Sunita", "Sony", "seema", "SM"]}
