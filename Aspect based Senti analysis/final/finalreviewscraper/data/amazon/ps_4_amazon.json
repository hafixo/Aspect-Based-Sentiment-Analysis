Guys buy dis if u want 3 games included or go\nfor 1TB version... Nice graphics and amazing output of gameplay. I also got\n1year warranty and 3 month membership with dis bundle.\n\n", "\ud83d\ude0dI finally ordered this much-awaited item in Great Indian Sale. The price was\naround 1000 less at that time. Seemed to me a nice deal as I got the Slim\nversion at a reasonable price with 3 games included.  \nIn the box I got :  \n1 PS4 500 GB Slim Version (Model CUH-2008A)  \n1 Dualshock 4 controller  \n3 Games (Horizon Zero Dawn, Ratchet and Clank, Driveclub)  \n1 Wired earphone (single earpiece)  \n1 HDMI cable  \n1 USB cable  \n2 Power cords (Don't know why)  \nPlaystation Plus membership coupon for 3 months  \n3 manuals  \n1 Warranty card  \n  \nThe Console :  \n\ud83d\udcfaWell, it's the well-known PS4 with 500 GB of storage, fair enough for a\nmoderate gamer like me. Else, I rarely download games either. I find it much\ncomfortable to purchase the disk online. So, 500 GB will do for me.  \n\ud83d\udcfaThe console looks great and that's a big charm of this Slim version.  \n\ud83d\udcfaThe model number of this console is CUH-2008 A, which I found hard to\nregister on Sony.co.in as it sometimes showed some error in model number and\nsometimes in serial number. I searched about this registration issue on net\nand found that most of the people are unable to register their PS on Sony.\nAnyway, I don't bother about it anymore.  \n  \nThe Controller :  \n\ud83c\udfaeThe controller has all the special features loaded which add to it's\nattraction and added to my admiration for it. It's signature blue light looks\nclassic but I think it's also responsible for the battery not lasting much as\nyou have to charge the controller frequently. (As compared to my PS3\ncontroller)  \n\ud83c\udfaeAnyway, the controller has a touchpad which also can be pressed and this\ntouchpad is very useful while writing a message, web surfing or entering\npasswords on your PS4.  \n\ud83c\udfaeThe R and L buttons and design of the controller have been upgraded which\nresults in improved accessibility as well as better grip indeed.  \n\ud83c\udfaeThere is a 3.5 mm jack to connect the earphones so that the audio is diverted\nto the earphones and you can play the game without disturbing anyone in the\nroom ! Great feature indeed !  \n\ud83c\udfaeThere is a charging port also beside the 3.5 mm jack which can be used to\nplace the controller to a charging dock, if you have one.  \n\ud83c\udfaeA small speaker grill is also provided under the touchpad which is used for\nsound output close to you.  \nGraphics :  \nI won't go in the technical details, but will surely assure you that the\ngraphics of PS4 are one of the many factors which add to the popularity of the\nPS4. Of course, it will be super crispy if you connect it to 4K or FullHD TV.  \n  \nMisc.:  \n\ud83c\udfaeThe interface of PS4 is classic and gives a Premium feel. It has many tabs\nand includes many new features like Notifications and Messages from other\nusers as well.  \n\ud83c\udfaeThe Shut down is a two step process in PS4 which looks impressive\nnonetheless.  \n\ud83c\udfaeOne important thing I want to quote is that PS4 does not work on inverter. If\nyou have a really Pure Sine-wave inverter, you are lucky. But else, you have\nto look for a good quality UPS to keep your PS4 running during power cuts.  \n\ud83c\udfaeThe game Driveclub (which is included with this bundle) is a superb racing\ngame with fantastic graphics, but I would suggest you never to connect your\nPS4 to internet while playing Driveclub as it will very soon fetch a huge\nupdate of 19 GB which will take ages to complete and the worst part is, you\nwon't be able to play this classic game unless you download the complete patch\n! \ud83d\ude16  \n  \nOverall, I will definitely recommend this great deal to the gaming\nenthusiasts. You will certainly love it !  \n  \nBy the way, the packing of the item was not good and the carton seemed nearly\ndismantled. It felt like the package had been tampered or something. Even the\nPS4 packet itself was torn at the bottom corner. Though I was happy to see the\nproduct safe and intact anyway !\n\n", "Great bundle, great console. Guys don't hesitate to buy it if u don't have a\n4k TV coz this console is great for FHD TV no need to buy ps4 pro so go grab\nthe deal it's a steal at this price.\n\n", "Bought this from elsewhere for much cheaper (without warranty).  \n  \nThe bundle itself is excellent, and provides games that are vastly different\nfrom each other. What are you waiting for? :)  \n  \nP.S.: For those with limited internet connections, be careful. Drive Club, for\nexample, quietly sneaks in a nearly 20 gig download in the background.\n\n", "Excellently packed by amazon forget the pro dont waste your money on a midgen\nupgrade console ultimately both will play same games go for this its a steal\ndeal. Just Close your eyes and press on the buy now \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04 Happy gaming .\n\n", "Initially planned on buying PS4 Pro, but dropped it since I don't have a 4K\nTV. I used to own a PS4, sold it about 2 years ago due to lack of time.

As an Indian, you might want to know that many\ngames have around 50 gb updates and considering the Indian internet situation,\nyou might be put off about it. Now I think that if you play a lot of video\ngames and you play different genres rather than just CoD or Fifa, you SHOULD\ninvest in a monthly maintenance fee. Think of it as having a monthly\nmaintenance cost of around Rs 1500/- for a good internet connection + PSPlus\nmembership(you get free 3 month membership with the box, then take the annual\none).  \n  \nAs for the games on the console, I personally think the order of great games\nis PS2 > PS3 > PS4 for RPG fans (like me). There are not too many good RPGs,\nlet alone exclusive RPGs. Apart from all the remasters, Persona 5, FF XV\nWitcher, Disgaea 5, Dragon Age Inquisition, South Park and Nier Automata are\ngreat (most are not exclusive and you can play em on a good PC). It's a pity\nthat we have so few RPGs on this system compared to PS2. [On a side note: Hey\nSony, where's my Suikoden, Shin Megami Tensei, and Tales of.., on PS4?!!]  \n  \nI think the PSPlus is worth it for amazing games every month and playing some\nmultiplayer games (which also requires a good ping) like Destiny 2, Overwatch.\nYou don't always get amazing games for free; its a hit or a miss. But on an\naverage you will have a few great games.  \n  \nNow this particular bundle is a total steal in terms of value. Horizon is a\ngreat looking game and Ratchet and Clank is a real treat. I don't like driving\ngames so I won't comment on Drive Club.\n\n", "It's owesom just go for it ..

PS4! Just go for it! Horizon zero dawn is one of top chart\ngame available in this bundle and Driveclub of course! It comes with 3 months\nPlayStation plus warranty! Also the cloudtail retailer (1 among 2) authorised\nretailer for Sony PS4 to sell in Amazon (mentioned in official web) it's\nultimate gaming experience! 500gb is enough keeping 5-6 games ! It's really\nworth every penny!!\n\n", "Sony does a great job with play station.  \nBeing new to console gaming, was a bit skeptical at first to buy PS4 but I did\nand I enjoy every moment of it.  \nOnly thing that bothers me is that DS4 doesn't have that premium feel to it.\nIt doesn't feel cheap though. Was expecting more out of DS4 built\nquality.Anyhow, I hope it'd serve me a good one year before I get to buy\nanother!\n\n", "Have been using the PS from 2nd gen.

You get three very good games in different genres,\n3 months of PS Plus and the 500 GB is more than enough for the casual gamer.\nIf you do need more storage, buy an external HDD when you need it. Buy an\nadditional controller for it, all less than 30k. Can\u2019t go wrong with this.\n\n", "Amazingly fast service by amazon, and guys this the most beneficial bundle to\npurchase, i have compare it with other bundles and this is the best bundle\namong them.
