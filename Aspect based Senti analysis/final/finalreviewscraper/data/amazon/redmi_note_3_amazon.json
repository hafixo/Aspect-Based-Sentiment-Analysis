Not\nreturn remember.  \n~~~~~~  \nAdvice:  \n~~~~~~  \nplease check all the Reviews first before purchase, because this is not the\nonly issue with the mobile. i am just explaining my issue i faced with this\nmobile.  \nThink before purchase, This is Somewhat good phone with great specs, but\ncoming to performance it does not meet the expectation, Even samsung on 7\nwhich was 1.5gb ram performance is far better than this redmi 4. As i bought\nthis for my wife, looking to specification, but finally realized that specs\nare not important Quality matters here. Where i have faced an issue after\nswitching on the mobile very very first time eagerly this mobile, while setup\nonly it went into not responding stage 3 times. i tough it might be temporary\nissue while setup, tough it repeats, later after installation of coffe game,\nit repeats too, no other apps were installed in it too. See when its unable to\nhandle even a single game, then whats the use of 3gb ram and octa core\nprocessor...? U can see plenty of reviews of heating issue, stucking, lagging,\nnot switching On, not charging what is this all...? is this really a Mobile,\nkeeping plenty of bugs and selling...? Only the front camera with age\nrecognition feature , finger print sensor, Mi Remote which supports to all\nAppliances was good in this mobile, no other i have seen, just good for\ncalling and chatting. specs are all with less quality. if you are some branded\nuser, u cannot use this moile even one day, it is like that. i cannot explain\nmore than this.  \n  \n~~~~~~~~  \nVerdict:  \n~~~~~~~~  \nIf you are a gamer please go with some other good branded mobile, for Normal\nuse like, calling, chatting and browsing its best phone.  \n  \n~~~~~  \nCONS:  \n~~~~~  \n1.)Heating,  \n2.)Not responding frequently,  \n3.)Performance is not like 3gb ram, its like 1gb ram. (Samsung on 7 is faster\nthan this, i am using it too.)  \n4.)slow charging.  \n5.) Not user friendly, settings confusing. Connecting to share it took lot's\nof time with mutiple attempts.  \n6.)phone skidding from hands due to very smooth finish.  \n  \n~~~~~  \nPROS:  \n~~~~~  \n1.) Camera features are good, especially age recognition of from camera.\nCamera quality is good, but don't expect like pro..  \n2.) Having remote feature. Almost it works with 90% of TV's , AC's, Set top\nboxes, ( Having almost all companies in settings, we have to choose them, so\nthat it works)  \n3.) Sound was audible and loud.  \n4.) Screen was smooth and touch was good as it does not feel sticky even when\nmy hands are with sweatings, this does not works in samsung, lenovo, iphone\netc..  \n5.) Finger print works like pro. Very fast, but located at back side.\n\n", "The phone is pretty good with it's power packed features in a pocket-friendly\nbudget. I brought this in about 6 months ago when it was launched and had been\nusing it since then. The mobile has served me well since then with no major\nproblems.  \n  \nMain features and pros are:  \n1\\. 3gb RAM (good for normal gaming and fluent working atmosphere)  \n2\\. 4100 mah power packed BATTERY (lasts half day on very heavy usage, lasts\none day easily on medium or normal usage, and will last 2 days on low usage)  \n3\\. FAST FINGERPRINT SENSOR (incredibly fast sensors used in this phone)  \n4\\. METAL FINISH body (feels good to hold the phone)  \n5\\. AWESOME CAMERA quality (pictures taken are very clear; both front and back\ncamera are quite satisfying)  \n6\\. Sim insertion TOOL is provided within the package  \n7\\. MiUi 8 is provided as the default UI (pretty good)  \n8\\. Not much bloatwares installed  \n9\\. The placement of DUAL speakers at the bottom is pretty handy as the sound\nwill be audible even if the device is place upside down or normally  \n10\\. The IR sensor is pretty cool feature (TV remote, AC remote)  \n11\\. Pretty fast charging time  \n12\\. Snapdragon cpu on which it runs is pretty FAST (smooth working)  \n  \nSome problems and issues I faced:  \n1\\. Slight heating issue when charging and while playing cpu and gpu intensive\ngames  \n2\\. Low mic volumes observed occasionally  \n3\\. There is no separate slot for memory card. It's either a dual sim phone or\na phone with single sim and a memory card at a time. This creates problems\nsometimes.  \n  \nThe back button is at the right side of home button and the recent button is\non the left side of the home button. The sim slots are on the left side top\nand the power and volume buttons are on the right side of the screen in your\nhand. The fingerprint sensor is at the back and the camera is aligned to the\ntop side with flash.  \n  \nFINAL VERDICT:  \nAltogether this phone is a complete package of features at a budget friendly\nprice. Very good camera quality and fast performance. It can be called a value\nfor money buy. Thumbs up for buying this phone.\n\n", "Honest and true review ...  \n\\+ Points  \n1\\. Build quality (don't use silicon pouch it's damaged ur plastic edges)  \n2\\. better looking (rich and royal looking at good price)  \n3\\. battery life (hard usage 1 day normal usage 1.5 to 2 days)  \n4\\. Performance ( it's almost good for heavy games it's awesome to lower\u200b\ngamers )  \n  \n5\\. Features  \nA. Fingerprint is superfine , some time it's work also wet hands  \nB. Infrared is good working but mi app want good development in this  \nC. Dual apps is very cool and want feature it's awesome  \nD. Dual space is give to you more privacy  \nE. Inbuilt apps are some are use some are waste it's consume more internal\nmemory... Security and app lock features is more helpful and good handling  \n  \n\\- points  \n1\\. Camera ( front is better )  \nIt's worst camera .. we can't take stable pics .. and it's can't capture the\ndetails .. it's just take a pic that's all.... Don't trust the review's .. I'm\nalso used Redmi 1s and 2 prime it's good that price but now using Redmi note 4\n, 3s prime , Redmi 4 (frnds) I'm fully disappointed with Redmi camera it's not\ngive the good camera in this price .  \n. One word to say if want camera go to other mobiles don't choose Redmi all\nare same and waste .... Camera apps can't change the hardware  \n  \n2\\. Screen  \nRedmi has not give a protected screen .. normal usage is not bad but I mention\nscratches on my Redmi mobile (Redmi 4 also) use tempered glass for avoiding\nscratches... If drop your mobile above the 6 or 7 feet it's definitely\nbroken.. one word to say if want good protection go for another mobile  \n  \n3\\. Charging time it's almost 100 % it's take 3:30 + ... It's not support fast\ncharge  \n  \n4\\. Build quality (plastic) in mobile top and bottom has plastic .. you use\nthe silicon pouch it's definitely damage with light holes .. go for hard and\nplastic pouches  \n  \n5\\. Speaker  \nThe sound was low ...  \n  \nI'm a fan of mi ..... Finally you have good performance (games , apps\nhandling) long battery buy it ... If want camera and screen go for another\n.... Really I'm telling 9000 is not good for camera go for 7000 veriant .....\nI'm telling a suggestion to you go for Lenovo k6 power it's give ..  \nBetter camera  \nGood display protection and Colour pixels (looking good)  \nGood sound (two loud speaker and Dolby)  \nSame battery life  \nBut 1000 extra and not available infrared\n\n", "\ud83d\udcdc HONEST REVIEW \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25  \n\u2022 Quality of the phone is superb beyond expectations.  \n\u2022 Screen quality is very good in terms of sharpness.  \n\u2022 Brightness of screen is bright enough to be able to view in a sharp sun\nlight as well.  \n\u2022 UI (User Interface) is very good and super easy to navigate.  \n\u2022 Doesn't lag for one bit.  \n\u2022 Battery backup is a god like (Last up to two full days with ine single\ncharge with heavy usage).  \n\u2022 Body is made of metal feels like more premium.  \n\u2022 Front Camera is also good and able to click very good and sharp photos but\nhad to compromise when in the dark.  \n\u2022 Back is also super good same as the front but video record at 30 fps at full\nhd thats a liitle  \nDownside.  \n\u2022 Another super feature is there is a IR Blaster in the phone that u can\ncontrol everything (TV , SETtop boxes, AC, Dvd player almost everything that\nis control by remote with IR blaster).  \n\u2022 Phone has ample amount of ram.  \n\u2022 The earpiece quality of the phone is also loud and clear.  \n\u2022 It also has noise cancellation with dedicated secondary mic as well.  \n\u2022 Flash of the phone is very bright as well.  \n\u2022 Killer feature is dual apps through which u can use two different mobile\nnumbers on the whatsapp all it does is clone the app which makes it two\nwhatsapp app but working with different mobile number.  \n\u2022 Proceesor is quite enough powerful to handle multitasking and smooth\ninternet browsing as well.  \n\u2022 The loud speaker of the is little less loud and less clear but good enough.  \n\u2022 Now for the games part yes games work fine NFS no limits frames are ok but\nnot like buttery smooth but can run without any lags or soo.  \n\u2022 Asphalt 8 also runs great and pretty well smooth and no lags at all.  \n\u2022 Finger print sensor is quite accurate and fast enough.  \n\u2022 the touch is very good as well and accurate.  \n\u2022 Screen front look is very good give u a curved glass design makes the look\nmore premium.  \n\u2022 It does comes with android 6.0 latest version.  \n\u2022 The volume rocker and the screen lock buttons are very good feels more\nclicky.  \n\u2022 Yes it does comes in black and it look soo soo damm cool in black.  \n\u2022 The charger is powerful and charges the phone pretty quick.  \n\u2022 U get a bigger screen as well.  \n\u2022 And yes it does have an headphone jack but u don't get the headphones with\nphones.  \n  \nGO FOR IT ITS THE BEST PHONE IN THIS RANGE.\n\n", "Update 21/1/18 Following are the Observations,  \n  \nBUILD QUALITY :--  \n\\---------------------  \n# Build Quality is Great and it looks very Rigid.  \n# Light Weight about 150g considering the size of phone.  \n# Matte Finish looks very Premium.  \n# Placement of Fingerprint Sensor is Perfect.  \n  \nPROCESSOR & MEMORY :--  \n\\------------------------------------  \n# Have Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 64 bit Processor(Quadcore) with Adreno 505\nGraphics Unit.  \n# It is Faster than Redmi Note 4 3GB version.(I have both version and have\ncompared via gaming)  \n# This Processor perfectly balance the Battery life & Performance.  \n# 3GB Ram is sufficient Enough for Heavy Multitasking because of its Fast\nProcessor.  \n# Has 32GB in-built memory with 128GB Memory Expansion option.

(But which smart phone doesn't get heated\nup with heavy usage? Tell me one). I notice only a little amount of heat in\nthe backside after playing Pokemon go for more than 4 hours. Remember Pokemon\ngo is a heavy game which uses mobile data and gps signal simultaneously to\nwork. And it also uses your camera as well.  \n  \nThe only problem I noticed though is, while charging, the phone gets heated\naround the camera and finger print area sensor. They have released an update\nto fix this after 1 week. But since it was a 'nightly' version, I didn't opt\nto download the update. I am now waiting for a stable update to come. (UPDATE\n: The 'Nightly' update I told is no longer there in the update page. Think\nthey have removed it. Which means a more stable update is going to come out\nsoon) I don't think there is anything to worry about that because, atleast we\nnow know that they are working on it and they have already rolled out an\nupdate solution. I think that's a great gesture from the company.  \n  \nThen there is this thing about Hybrid sim card slot. I have been using two sim\ncards and a 16 gb memory card for the last 2 years. I thought it would be\ndifficult to live without them, since I carry lots of important personal files\nin my memory card. I invested 2-3 hours to sort all those photos and videos\nscattered across hundreds of folders and subfolders in my SD card using my PC\nand then sorted them well and copied to my new Redmi 4. It was totally worth\nit. I got rid of many duplicate files as well. 32 gb (25gb available) is more\nthan enough for an average user in my opinion. For me, my photos and music\ncollection is very important to me. Redmi 4 had abundant storage space to\nintake them all. I now use 2 sim cards. I use Google Photos to backup my\nphotos and some online music services like saavn and Jiomusic. Now I don't\neven think a memory card is necessary at all.  \n  \nI was among the very first to buy this smartphone in their first launching\nsale itself. I was able to place the order quickly as there wasn't much demand\nlike it has now. It was totally a blind purchase. Only thing I knew was it's\nname and it has 3 gb ram and 32 gb internal memory. (It showed 'Redmi 4, 3GB,\n32GB' in the title). I didn't know any other specs. I checked them only after\nI placed the order. But ever since I got this phone in my hand, I became a\ngreat fan of Xiomi, truly. It looked stunning. Such a brilliant smartphone at\nan affordable price range like this is truly a blessing. Thank you guys.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 13 June 2017", "on 11 December 2017", "on 20 June 2017", "on 29 May 2017", "on 1 September 2017", "on 29 May 2017", "on 17 July 2017", "on 31 May 2017", "on 27 September 2017", "on 27 June 2017"], "reviewer": ["AV!D", "Samar", "Sandeep kumar", "Balraj Singh Virk", "Barinder Pal Singh", "KJ", "Jyothirmai", "Sameer Patil", "KJ", "Asif"]},

It\nwas samsung galaxy ace with 256 MB of memory. I had used it for 3 years and\nthen I switched to more advanced phone. I had visited to my hometown and my\nfather noticed my new phone. He enquired about my old phone and shown interest\nto use it. Phone was in good condition, I changed the battery and gave it to\nhim. Initially he used the touch screen phone just like any other key based\nphone. Then, in 2015, he asked me how to use whatsapp and gmail in smart\nphone. I created his whatsapp account but unfortunately, he couldn't use it\nbecause of low memory. He wasn't aware of memory and application stuffs so he\nnever complained. He changed the battery couple of times and used the phone\nfor 3.5+ years.  \n  \nOne day, I called my father's cell and he wasn't reachable. I called my mother\nand found that his phone had suddenly stopped working, and he had given it for\nrepairing. When I talked to him, I found him worrying about his contacts saved\nin phone. He again didn't complain and was optimistic about old phone.  \n  \nI felt embarrassed. I never realized how he managed with an obsolete phone. I\nordered a Redme 4 with 32GB memory on Amazon. My order was not placed\nsuccessfully. I re-ordered on 7th Oct, and it was reaching to my hometown, a\nremote village in Jharkhand, on 17th Oct. It was reaching a day before\ndeewali. I felt so good that only Amazon can deliver anywhere in India. I\ncouldn't go home but was super excited to know his reaction. A surprise\ndelivery by online retailer in my remote village - I thought it would be a\ntopic of discussion in my village.  \n  \nUnfortunately, I recieved this message  \n  \nYour package is being returned because it was refused at delivery or the order\nwas cancelled.  \n  \nI had to call my home to know if any courier had come that day. I found that\nno courier had visited them. I called customer care and explained them that\nneither I had cancelled the order nor it was refused at delivery point. I was\nvery sad and was too weak to display my anger. I explained my situation and\nasked him to refund the money if Amazon couldn't reach my village. Lady at the\nphone asked me for a final chance. Sir, just believe on Amazon once for the\nfinal time. I said,\u201d Ok. Go ahead place the order again. It will again take 12\ndays to reach\u201d.  \n  \nI received a message that my order, which was placed on 18th Oct, would be\nreaching on 8th Nov. I was pretty sure that it won't reach, and anyway my\nsurprise wasn't a surprise anymore.  \n  \nAgain to my surprise, my phone beeped and I saw this:  \nFather on Whatsapp : Hello  \nTime : 23rd Oct  \n  \nDelivered in 5 days  \n  \nPhone delivered on 23rd October itself. Amazon is Not That Bad. Many times we\nare dissatisfied with the service but Amazon is customer oriented. By the way\ncourior guy had to travel 60Km to and fro on bike to reach my village.  \n  \nAmazon delivers promises even to rural India.\n\n", "Even though it goes on sale just once in a week, I like how it goes out-of-\nstock in a few minutes. That's what made me get my hands on this phone to see\nwhats that special... so here is my review  \n  \nFirst lets start with the positive side  \n  \nPros :  \n  \n* The build and design is absolutely stunning  \n* I got the black one and it looks rich like an over expensive device  \n* They call it the 2.5D curved glass and that adds a good look to the display  \n* coming to the display section, the colors are perfectly saturated and displayed the best way it could  \n* With the 3 GB RAM, the device has shown no lags and memory management is also good with all the background process  \n* The 13 MP camera snaps pics in perfect lighting conditions. The 5MP front cam is also not disappointing  \n* Battery performance is good. Under normal usage conditions, the battery lasted for a day and a half  \n  \nCons:  \n  \n* The main downside is the device lacking backlit navigation buttons. Its a dark device in my case and it's not a good move to omit them  \n* It has stereo speakers at the bottom which adds an awkward noise to the sound coming out of it and the speakers are not that good  \n* The rear camera's performance in artificial lighting condition is not that good ( some pics are below )  \n* The backside of the phone attracts oil smudges a lot.  \n  \nAll positives and negatives aside... If you're looking for a device with\noptimal performance and long lasting battery, then this might be a good pick.\nBut it is not suitable for photo heads who likes to snap pics with their\nphones. So if you're expecting dramatic photos, then this might disappoint\nyou.  \n  \nFor a detailed review you can visit my YT channel --> 'it assistors'\n\n", "Superior smartphone mi 4 ..... love it  \n  \nXiaomi\u2019s Redmi series has changed the expectations of what a budget phone\nshould offer, at least in India. So it\u2019s not surprising to see the company\nlaunch one Redmi phone after another this year. The Mi phones are coming,\npromises Xiaomi, but for now the mantra for success is Redmi, Redmi and some\nmore Redmi.  \n  \nThe latest is the Redmi 4 smartphone that marks the return of the budget\nseries with a starting price\u00a0of Rs 6,999. This time, however, there\u2019s a 4GB\nRAM and 64GB storage version as well. We got the Redmi 4 unit with 3GB\nRAM+32GB storage for review. So does the Redmi 4 live up to the expectations?\nHere\u2019s our review.  \n  \n\ufffc  \n  \nSpecifications:\u00a05-inch HD display |Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor at 1.4\nGhz |3GB RAM+32GB storage (expandable) | 13MP rear camera with PDAF, LED flash\n+ 5 MP front camera | 4100 mAh battery |\u00a0Android\u00a0M with MIUI 8 |\u00a0See full\nspecifications of Redmi 4\u00a0here\u00a0|  \n  \nPrice:\u00a0Rs 8,999 for the 3GB RAM+32GB storage  \n  \nRedmi 4  \n  \nRedmi 4 sports a metal unibody design, just like the Redmi Note 4. In fact, it\nis fair to call this a mini Redmi Note 4. It\u2019s good to see Xiaomi introduce a\nmatte black variant at this price point, however the phone is prone to picking\nup dust, fingerprint smudges on the back.  \n  \nRedmi 4 is a like mini Redmi Note 4 when it comes to design.  \n  \nThe volume rockers and power button are on the right side, the SIM tray on the\nleft side. It has antenna lines at the top and bottom on the rear of the\nphone. The camera lens is tucked away neatly in one corner with the LED flash\nplaced before it. The fingerprint scanner is at the back.  \n  \nXiaomi has added dual speakers at the bottom, and there\u2019s a micro-USB port at\nthe bottom of the phone. There\u2019s glass all over the front, along with the\nfront camera on top. Yes, this one still has a 3.5mm headphone jack on top,\nbut you\u2019ll have to purchase the headphones separately.  \n  \nGiven the 5-inch form factor this is compact, and will fit in your jeans\npocket. Also you can easily use this smartphone with one hand. I would say\nthis is one of the nicest-looking devices you can get for Rs 6,999. However,\ngetting a cover is a must for this phone.  \n  \nRedmi 4 sports a 13MP rear camera on the back.  \n  \nWhat\u2019s good?  \n  \nRedmi 4 has 5-inch HD resolution display, and while 720p might be a bummer, it\nworks pretty well for this screen size. You can read easily on this, even in\nbright sunlight. For video consumption, this is a more than acceptable display\nconsidering the price.  \n  \nBattery is the highlight of the Redmi 4. It will easily last more than a day\nwith heavy usage. I didn\u2019t have to charge this phone on daily basis. For most\nbudget phone buyers, this is a major relief point. In the PCMark battery test,\nit scores around 12 hours plus.  \n  \nBut yes, charging this one takes some time. I used this phone as WiFi hotspot\nto set up another, much more expensive phone and even though Redmi 4 was under\n40 per cent, it lasted the whole day. The battery saver option is another\nfeature in the\u00a0phone\u00a0that\u00a0you can rely on to extend your phone\u2019s usage. Even\nwith under six per cent charge, it managed to last the 40-minute ride \u00a0back\nhome.  \n  \nFor a budget phone, I\u2019d say this is impressive. I used this phone with a 4G\nSIM card.  \n  \nRedmi 4 has dual speakers at the bottom of the device.  \n  \nPerformance of the Redmi 4 is certainly above average when you compare it with\nother phones in similar price range. Benchmarks scores might not be that high,\nbut the 3GB RAM version we got can handle multitasking easily. If your major\npoints of consumption are YouTube,\u00a0Facebook, and the rest of the social media\napps, this phone is more than enough. Side note: You can run games like\nAsphalt 8, etc on this, but there is a noticeable lag at times.  \n  \nPCMark battery test, Antutu and GeekBench scores for Redmi 4.  \n  \nComing to the camera, Redmi 4 has 13MP rear camera, which manages to get some\nreally nice shots when the light is proper. It is quick to focus, though HDR\nresults take some time to process and the colours don\u2019t look so bad. The low-\nlight performance is not terrible, considering this is a budget phone.\nHowever, pictures do have noise on the edges, which is hard to miss.  \n  \nSample shots from Redmi 4. (Image resized for web)Sample shots from Redmi 4.\n(Image resized for web)Sample shots from Redmi 4. (Image resized for web)  \n  \nThe fingerprint scanner is now standard across all storage options and it\nworks pretty accurately most of the time. Redmi 4 runs the MIUI8 on Android M\nand you get features like dual WhatsApp and dual Facebook Messenger. \u00a0I like\nhow Xiaomi\u2019s UI will put all the annoying SMSes under the notifications tab,\nrather than flooding your inbox with them. These neat tricks make the MIUI8\nactually more useful than a lot of other \u2018customised UIs\u2019 in the market.  \n  \nSo what\u2019s not good?  \n  \nThis phone is still running Android M. Now Xiaomi has promised an Android\nNougat build, but they sure could have launched the phone with the latest\nbuild. After all, Android O is already here.  \n  \nThe low-light performance is still far from perfect. Colours like red tend to\nlook washed out in some of the photos. Also in bright sunlight, it\u2019s hard to\nfigure out how the final picture will look like at times.  \n  \nSample shots from Redmi 4. (Image resized for web)  \n  \nThe phone tends to heat up at times, especially when you leave it for charging\nfor sometime or are playing games for a really long time. However, this is not\na major problem, and not something that would discourage usage of the phone.  \n  \nShould you buy?  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 is for those users, who want long battery life, and a phone\nthat works just right without paying over Rs 10,000. I\u2019d say this phone has\nthe advantage over Redmi 4A because the battery will last you much more, and\nfor Indian users this is a crucial factor to keep in mind.  \n  \nPlus the 5-inch form factor means this will appeal to those who don\u2019t like big\ndisplays, and want a device that easily fits in their pant pockets. Get the\nRedmi 4 if you\u2019ve been on the lookout for a new budget smartphone. But if you\nwant to pay more, the market has other options as well, including Redmi Note\n4,\u00a0Moto G5 Plus, and others.\n\n", "4 stars for Redmi 4 mobile and 5 stars for Amazon and its delivery.  \n  \nAbout product : It is the best choice for the price range less than 10k.  \n  \nPros:  \n\\+ Slim and easily operate in one hand. Back cover is very slippery due to\nmetal finish, suggested to use case cover to avoid slipping from hands.  \n\\+ 2.5D curved glass and back cover metalic finish give premium look to the\nmobile.  \n\\+ It supports Jio 4G VoLTE. Voice call clearity is good and no issues with\nnetwork signal or wifi or wifi hotspot.  \n\\+ Good performance with the Snapdragon 435 SoC, didnt feel any lagginess.  \n\\+ Rear camera is 13mp shooter and good quality images in natural lighting.\nNot so great in artificial lighting. Front camera is 5mp and good for selfies.  \n\\+ Supports most of the apps and games.  \n\\+ Good finger print response, very accurate always. Built in security app\nused to lock the apps (using both finger print or pattern/pin), no need of\nthird party apps to lock/protect apps. Antivirus app comes built in, top of\nthat we can use other security protection applications also.  \n\\+ Supports OTG devices. GPS and Compass sensors are giving exact location\ndetails to use in the map.  \n\\+ Good battery backup, solidly it comes 1 to 1.5 days of dual sim (3G+4G),\nfb, whatsapp and checking mails usage, still there will be 25-30% battery left\nat end of the day. Heavy gaming - more than 12 hrs.  \n\\+ Custom friendly UI interface, thanks to MIUI developers.  \n\\+ Some people complaining about heating issues, but I did not feel any\nheating issue even with high graphics game usuage (Asphalt 8, Modern combat).\nFeel that they didnt do regular patch update. I do regular patch update\nimmediately when it comes on OTA, that could be reason that I didnt get\nheating issues.  \n  \nCons:  \n\\- No turbo charger with the package. It has regular 2.0 Amp charger only. We\ncan still use fast charger as the mobile has Snapdragon 435 processor which\nsupports fast charging.  \n\\- No screen production like Gorilla glass 3/4 or Ashahi dragontrail. Within a\nmonth, my mobile got hairline crack in screen for accidental drop from less\nthan one feet hieght. So only they didnt mention anything in description about\nscreen protection.  \n\\- MIUI consumes more RAM. Always it shows 1.5GB RAM usage (out of 3GB) even\nthough when no apps running in background.  \n\\- No regular Android OS version upgrade. Still in Marshmallow based MIUI 8.5.\nReceiving regular MIUI patch update for 3 to 4 months once, but not OS version\nupgrade. Shortly we will get Android orea in other mobiles, but Redmi 4 is far\nbehind and stuck with Marshmallow. It is only problem with MIUI based\nproducts. MI has to think about this.  \n  \nAbout amazon.in and its delivery:  \n\\+ It is great as it is always.  \n\\+ Good packaging.  \n\\+ Delivered even before the estimated.  \n\\+ I bought it in Tuesday flash sale, the product claim went 100% within 2\nminutes, but I was added in the queue for waiting list and placed the order\nwhen my turn comes.  \n  \nThis is review of the Redmi 4 mobile after 6 months usage.\n\n", "amazing phone only in 8999 /-  \n  \nPositives  \nGood display  \nImpressive camera performance  \nSmooth performance  \nAndroid Marshmallow  \nRating  \nBattery  \n9.0  \nDisplay  \n8.5  \nCamera  \n8.3  \nPerformance  \n8.7  \nSoftware  \n7.8  \nDesign  \n9.0  \nBottom Line  \n8.6  \nRedmi 4  \nby Xiaomi  \nIn all likelihood, Xiaomi\u2019s got another winner on its hands in terms of sales.\nIf you\u2019re planning to pick up a budget smartphone right now, it\u2019s hard to look\nfurther than Redmi 4. At this stage, one can safely say that it\u2019s hard to go\nwrong with a Xiaomi.  \n  \nThree years after it set foot in the Indian market, the Xiaomi juggernaut is\nunstoppable, and with each budget smartphone, the company sets new benchmarks\nin terms of value for money offering as well as sales figures.  \n  \nAfter the huge success of Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4A, the company has recently\nlaunched the successor of Redmi 3S that was launched last year \u2013 Redmi 4.\nApart from being an iterative upgrade, the Redmi 4 packs in a fingerprint\nsensor this time around and comes in three memory variants.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 looks like a capable phone on the specifications sheet in the\nbudget smartphone market where some compromises are certain. Can Redmi 4 rise\nabove those to offer a great value-for-money smartphone and hit new sales\nrecords? Let\u2019s find out in this comprehensive review.  \n  \nFor this review, I took the mid-variant of the Redmi 4, the one with 3 GB of\nRAM and 32 GB of internal storage, for a spin. The retail unit was provided by\nXiaomi for the purpose of this review.  \nDesign  \n  \nWith a unibody metal construction, the Redmi 4 follows the design language of\nRedmi Note 4. There are curved edges with a curved 2.5D glass on the front\nwhich aids the ergonomics. The highlight of the design is of course the\ncompact form factor owing to the 5-inch display. It fits quite well in one\u2019s\npalms and single-handed usage is a breeze.  \n  \nThe build quality is excellent and it feels solid, and the matte black variant\nlooks great and gives a very premium feel.  \n  \nHowever, the three capacitive buttons behind the display are not backlit. It\nis disorienting at first, but you impulsively know where your thumb needs to\ngo after a few days of usage.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 might be a budget phone but there\u2019s no compromise on the\naesthetics. In fact, with this outing \u2013 like before \u2013 the company sets the\nstandards for what affordable smartphones should look and feel like in 2017.  \n  \nDisplay  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 sports a 5-inch HD display with a 1280 x 720 resolution. There\u2019s a\n2.5D curved glass, similar to the Redmi Note 4. It\u2019s toughened glass, although\nthere\u2019s no Gorilla Glass protection.  \n  \nWhile the specifications sheet watchers would\u2019ve liked a Full HD display, I\nthink it would\u2019ve been an overkill on a 5-inch budget smartphone and obviously\nhurt the battery life.  \n  \nThe HD display nevertheless looks fantastic in terms of color reproduction and\nviewing angles. The images and text looks sharp, and it is clearly one of the\nbest displays on smartphones in this price segment. Maintaining a perfect\nbalance, it is a crisp and vivid display without the colors looking\noversaturated.  \n  \nPerformance  \n  \nPowered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz\ncoupled with Adreno 505 GPU, the Redmi 4 comes in three memory variants \u2013\nthere\u2019s one with 2 GB RAM and 16 GB internal storage, another one with 3 GB of\nRAM along with 32 GB of storage, and the top variant with 4 GB of RAM and 64\nGB of internal storage.  \n  \nThe mid variant that I used for this review had just over 25 GB free memory\nout-of-the box.  \n  \nThe Snapdragon 435 is a pretty snappy chip, and the Redmi 4 chugs along nicely\nin daily usage. In my three weeks of usage, I haven\u2019t really encountered any\nsluggishness or lags. You can also play most of the graphic-intensive games,\nalbeit with a few frame skips here and there or graphic settings turned down.\nOne of the impressive things is that even while gaming, the phone did not get\nhot.  \n  \nThe 4,100 mAh battery on the Redmi 4 saves you from the constant battery\nanxiety. A day and a half on a single charge is easily manageable for most\ncasual users which is impressive really. Even on moderate to higher usage, the\nphone managed to offer more than a day of battery life.  \n  \nHardware  \n  \nJust like the Redmi Note 4, the Redmi 4 packs in an IR blaster that you can\nconfigure to use your phone as a remote control for several electronic\nappliances at your home. The fingerprint scanner located at the back is quite\ngood, and apart from authentication, can also be used to take photos,\nespecially those selfies.  \n  \nThe dual SIM smartphone features a hybrid slot, so essentially, you can either\nuse two SIM cards or one SIM card and one microSD card. If you need to use two\nSIMs and are a content hog, maybe you\u2019d like to opt for the top variant that\noffers 64 GB internal storage.  \n  \nWhile the battery life on the Redmi 4 is stellar, it is disappointing that\nthere is no fast charging support on the device. The issue is magnified in\nphones which pack in larger batteries because it takes even longer to charge\nthe phone completely.  \n  \nCamera  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 packs a 13MP rear camera with LED flash that can manage some\ngreat shots with good color reproduction and sharpness.  \n  \nOutdoors in daylight, the phone really surprises with details it manages to\ncapture and overall clarity. Even the macro shots and close-up portraits turn\nout to be great. The PDAF works quite well and the camera focuses on subjects\nin a snap.  \n  \nIn low light, the camera manages to click some decent shots, but there\u2019s a lot\nof noise in the pictures. Even indoors, the photos take a hit and are average\nat best. But this is a budget smartphone we\u2019re talking about and it does\nbetter than what most in this segment manage to achieve.  \n  \nXiaomi deserves credit for its impressive camera algorithms that makes the\nRedmi 4 a fast and dependable shooter.  \n  \nThe 5-megapixel front-facing camera manages decent selfies that are good\nenough for social sharing. There\u2019s nothing special there, although most would\nnot expect that anyway.  \n  \nSoftware  \nThe Redmi 4 runs MIUI 8 on top of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. MIUI is Xiaomi\u2019s\nproprietary customization layer on top of Android. It is heavily skinned, and\na totally different UI altogether than stock Android.  \n  \nMy biggest grouse with this phone is that it runs Android Marshmallow in the\nsecond quarter of 2017. Xiaomi does offer a beta version of Android 7.0 Nougat\nfor users interested in testing the same, and expectedly it would be released\nto the general public soon enough.  \n  \nThankfully though, MIUI 8 is one of the better Android skins out there and has\na lot of fans. There\u2019s evident attention to detail and unlike most skins from\nChinese players, the user experience is polished and quite cohesive.  \n  \nSEE ALSO:  \nWhat\u2019s new in MIUI 8  \nToday Xiaomi presented the world with the Mi Max, a beast of a phone featuring\na 6.44-inch display and a 4,850 mAh battery. The Mi Max brings something new\non the software side as well: the \u2026  \n  \nMIUI packs in several useful apps like FM radio, recorder, compass, torch, and\nmore. There\u2019s also a security app which bundles a lot of utilities for\nmaintenance and optimization of the software.  \n  \nIf you\u2019ve used a Xiaomi phone in the past, MIUI is a comfortable territory for\nyou. However, if this is your first one, getting comfortable with MIUI is not\nmuch of a task. It is an intuitive interface packed with nifty little features\neverywhere.  \n  \nSpecifications  \n  \nOperating System MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow  \nDisplay 5-inch HD(1280 x 720)  \n2.5D curved glass display  \n450nit brightness  \nProcessor 1.4GHz Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435  \nAdreno 505 GPU  \nRAM 2/3/4 GB  \nInternal Storage 16/32/64 GB  \nExpandable up to 128 GB with microSD card  \nRear Camera 13 MP with LED flash  \nf/2.0 aperture  \n5P lens  \nPhase-detection Auto-focus (PDAF)  \nFront Camera 5 MP  \nf/2.2 aperture  \nBattery 4,100 mAh  \nDimensions 139.24 x 69.96 x 8.65 mm  \nWeight 150 grams  \nGallery  \n  \nPricing and final thoughts  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 is definitely the new benchmark for other budget smartphones to\nmatch up to.  \nStarting at 8999 for the base variant, the Redmi 4 ticks all the right boxes\nand there is hardly anything to complain. It\u2019s a great package with solid\nchassis, Qualcomm\u2019s newer chipset, decent camera, and great battery life. The\nonly shortcoming of the device is lack of Android Nougat out of the box.  \n  \nIf you can up your budget, the middle variant at \u20b98,999 is the best pick of\nthe three since it offers just the right balance of performance and price. The\ntop spec\u2019d variants of course great too, but you can also look at other\noptions in the market at that price or go for it only if you need all that\nstorage.  \n  \nIn all likelihood, Xiaomi\u2019s got another winner on its hands in terms of sales.\nIf you\u2019re planning to pick up a budget smartphone right now, it\u2019s hard to look\nfurther than Redmi 4. At this stage, one can safely say that it\u2019s hard to go\nwrong with a Xiaomi.\n\n", "I bought this phone for my Dad, he's using for past one month so I though to\nwrite this review for whomever looking or thinking to purchase it.  \n  \n\\- First of all, finish of this phone is quiet nice if you look from price\nperspective although I didn't like the sim tray of this \"bad quality\", till\nnow phone is working smooth and lag free.  \n\\- Now coming to memory, I bought 32gb variant and total available storage was\nonly 24.20gb approx. so keep in mind if you are looking for storing more\nsongs/media/docs you better get 64gb variant.  \n\\- Camera quality is Okay-ish, not that good not that bad.  \n\\- Android you will get is Nougat running on Qualcomm Snapdragon 435.  \n\\- you need to purchase cover for this phone separately because back is quiet\nslippery.  \n\\- you won't get any earphones along with this phone so keep in mind that.  \n  \n>> Overall good phone in this budget range, go for it without any second\nthought!  \n  \nIf you got any query feel free to ask..\n\n", "It\u2019s no secret that the affordable Redmi 3s smartphone has been a huge success\nfor Xiaomi in India. In fact over the weekend, the company revealed that it\nsold 4 million Redmi 3s smartphones in nine months. And now, Xiaomi has\nlaunched a new device that replaces the Redmi 3s.  \n  \nToday, Xiaomi launched the Redmi 4 in India. Available in three variants, the\ndevice is priced at Rs 6,999, Rs 8,999 and Rs 10,999. While all three variants\nare powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 435 SoC, the difference is in the RAM and\ninternal storage. The base variant comes with 2GB of RAM, and 16GB internal\nstorage, the mid variant comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage, while the\nmost expensive variant comes with 4GB of RAM, and 64GB internal storage.\nHaving spent sometime with the Xiaomi Redmi 4 32GB variant, here\u2019s my review.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 design  \nThe moment you lay your eyes on the Redmi 4, two things strike you. One, it\nlooks premium, and two it looks like a carbon copy of the Redmi Note 4. Ask\nXiaomi, and it seems to be a deliberate move on the part of the company. The\nRedmi Note 4 set the standards on what an affordable smartphone should look\nand feel like, and the new Redmi 4 carries forward that tradition.A unibody\nmetal design with curved edges, and a curved 2.5D glass on top of the display\nreally add to the aesthetics of the smartphone. The buttons on the side offer\nnice tactile feedback when pressed, and the overall build quality is quite\nsolid. But what really tips the scales is the overall form factor. With\nAndroid smartphones getting bigger by the day, Xiaomi has done well to stick\nwith a 5-inch display, and the Redmi 4 fits really well in one\u2019s palms.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 display  \nThe Redmi 4 flaunts a 5-inch HD (720p) IPS display, which would be a tad\ndisappointing in comparison tests. But in real-world usage, the display\nperforms quite well. Color reproduction is good, text look sharp, and viewing\nangles are good enough. Visibility under direct sunlight is also quite decent.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 performance  \nUnder the hood is Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 435 SoC, which is paired with either\n2GB of RAM, 3GB of RAM or 4GB of RAM, depending upon the variant you buy. I\nused the 3GB variant, and for its price, the overall performance was quite\ngood. The smartphone was able to handle all day-to-day tasks easily, and to an\nextent, some graphic-intensive games as well. Games like Asphalt 8: Airborne\nor Riptide GP2 ran smoothly with the graphics settings turned down.The\nsoftware bit no doubt plays a big part in the overall performance, since\nXiaomi uses a heavily modified version of Android. The Redmi 4 runs on Android\nMarshmallow-based MIUI 8.2. As you would expect from Chinese OEMs, there is no\napp drawer and all the apps are placed on the homescreens ala Apple\u2019s iOS.\nMIUI also offers a bunch of customization options that can be tweaked for a\nmore personal experience. There are also exclusive features like \u2018Dual-Apps\u2019,\nwherein you can use two accounts on a single app. Similarly, you can also use\ntwo phone numbers to create two accounts on WhatsApp.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 battery  \nAnother talking point is no doubt the battery. With a 4,100mAh unit fuelling\nthe device, you won\u2019t have to constantly hunt for a charger. During my usage,\nthe battery was able to consistently survive more than a day on a single\ncharge. My usage includes a connected fitness tracker, two email accounts,\nmultiple social accounts, Slack, WhatsApp, a bit of gaming and regularly\nswitching between Wi-Fi and 4G. On a more judicial usage, I was even able to\nget through a day and half on a single charge. My only grouch however is that\nthe bundled charger doesn\u2019t support fast charging.The Xiaomi Redmi 4\u2019s\nphotographic chops are just about decent, especially when you consider the\nprice tag. The smartphone is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear camera with LED\nflash and support for phase detection auto-focus (PDAF support). While the\npresence of PDAF helps in quickly focussing on subjects, the overall results\nare a tad underpar. You are only likely to be satisfied when clicking photos\nin bright sunlight. In this condition, the camera is able to capture plenty of\ndetails, and color reproduction is quite decent. The dynamic range adjustment\nis not always perfect but the HDR does an okay job bringing the detail back to\nthe shadows.But in less than ideal conditions though, the photos seem a bit\ndull and lack character. Things get worse when you move indoors, with photos\nmarred with noise. For selfies, there\u2019s a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The\nresults are average at best, and are suitable for quickly sharing on social\nmedia.Xiaomi Redmi 4 features  \nThe new Redmi 4 comes with a fingerprint sensor placed at the back. The sensor\nis fast enough to unlock the device from sleep mode, and is also quite useful\nwhen clicking photos \u2013 especially selfies. Another interesting inclusion is an\nIR blaster at the top, which means your smartphone can replace a remote to\ncontrol devices like televisions and air conditioners.  \n  \nThe smartphone comes with the usual bevy of connectivity options like 4G with\nVoLTE support, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, and 3.5mm audio jack.\nDuring my usage I didn\u2019t experience any major call drops and the voice from\nthe earpiece was loud and crisp even in noisy environments.

With\nprices starting from Rs 6,999, Xiaomi is again setting a standard for what\nshould be on offer when buying smartphones on a budget.\n\n", "A great option for a budget Android phone. MIUI system gives you all the\nnecessary inbuilt applications for your smartphone, you don't need to worry\nabout any kind of system corruption problems, MIUI itself optimize and\nmaintain everything.  \nOver all this is a great option of a budget phone. \ud83d\udc4d\n\n", "I have been using it for 15 days, I ll give every pro and con about the phone\nand if you should buy it. Make sure you read the full review!  \nPros  \n1\\. Decent camera quality for the price. Not great, just Good.  \n2\\. Excellent battery life, lasts at least 12-14 hours with heavy usage and\nmulti tasking.  \n3\\. Mobile looks like a million bucks, Its definitely one if the best looking\nmobiles in any price range and Awesome build quality.  \n4\\. Finger print scanner works great.  \n5\\. Sound quality is top notch. BUT  \nCONS:  \n1\\. Touch is sometimes not responsive and sometimes over responsive.  \nIf you're scrolling up or down let's suppose in Whatsapp, you will open some\nchat trying to scroll unintentionally. It gets annoying if it happens once\nevery 3-4 times. And while searching google images, it always opens some pics\ni don't intend to, So to sum up,  \nTOUCH IS NOT WORKING WELL ON A TOUCH SCREEN PHONE.  \n2\\. Even listening to songs OR watching videos on youtube for an hour heats up\nthe phone badly. Watching videos with 360p for above 2 hours makes the phone\nhot enough to make you feel like it will blast some day.  \nYOU CANNOT WATCH MOVIES ON THIS MOBILE FOR LONGER TIMES.  \n3\\. While charging, the phone gets very, very hot, hotter than it gets while\nwatching movies. Basically this phone is a HEAT MAGNET. Whatever you do,\nexpect the heat.  \n4\\. Multi-tasking lags. Not great for multi tasking as the phone takes about 2\nseconds to work after the app is opened. And it takes about 2 seconds to open\nthe app. So expect 5 second wait time if you are a multi tasker. Sometimes\nSnapchat and Insta take more time to load than whatsapp and facebook.  \nGOOD ENOUGH FOR MULTITASKING IF YOU ARE AN AVERAGE USER. IF YOU ARE A HEAVY\nMULTI TAKSER, DONT BUY. IT CANT HANDLE HEAVY USAGE.  \n5\\. Sometimes almost all apps crash for the first time and then work fine 2nd\ntime.  \nVERDICT: If you are a normal user with only whatsapp and occassional facebook,\nwithout any other social or heavy apps, it still annoys with the touch but its\nOK-ISH. Heat is the most common thing for this phone. Touch is supposed to be\nworking good on touch phones which ain't the case for this. I used samsung j7\nfor a year and it worked 100 times better than this mobile. This phone is all\nhype and full crap!  \nMYTH : REDMI 4 HAS 2 SPEAKERS.  \nREALITY: REDMI4 HAS ONLY HAS ONE SPEAKER AND THE OTHER IS MICROPHONE.\n\n", "Hi..dosto..  \nMob liye..1 hi din hue h...jyadaa to nhi..  \nBut..jitnaa mi4 k iss mob me ptaa chalaa h...wo..to.jrur..share krna\nchaahunga..  \nSo...  \nIts  \nLook...nice  \nCamra .. beautiful in day and ni8 n good for selfee as wel  \n  \nBattery.. dhaasu....lambee waali...life h.. really  \n  \nSmooth in multiple application...like..watching.. cricket {Eng vs Bang}\nlistening music..  \nGames..facebook watsapp hike.....

(Remember this before Purchase)  \n@ There is NO Earphone in Box.  \n@ Touch Buttons on the phone are NOT Backlit.  \n  \nFollowing are the Observations,  \n  \nBUILD QUALITY :--  \n\\---------------------  \n# Build Quality is Great and it looks very Rigid.  \n# Light Weight about 150g considering the size of phone.  \n# Matte Finish looks very Premium.  \n# Placement of Fingerprint Sensor is Perfect.  \n  \nPROCESSOR & MEMORY :--  \n\\------------------------------------  \n# Have Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 64 bit Processor(Quadcore) with Adreno 505\nGraphics Unit.  \n# It is Faster than Redmi Note 4 3GB version.(I have both version and have\ncompared via gaming)  \n# This Processor perfectly balance the Battery life & Performance.  \n# 3GB Ram is sufficient Enough for Heavy Multitasking because of its Fast\nProcessor.  \n# Has 32GB in-built memory with 128GB Memory Expansion option.

In which I\nfind this Phone to be BEST all rounder.  \nHas good Processor, Excellent battery backup, Premium Design and Most\nimportantly its Affordable.  \nIf you are looking for Budget Phone, then this is your Ultimate Solution.  \n  \nThank You for reading this Review.\n\n", "The phone has a great value for money proportion and stands out on most point\nconsidering the price point.  \nThings I like-  \n1.The Form Factor is just perfect.I am not a big fan of 5.5 and 5 inch jus\nplays cool.The gripping is overall good and doesnt slips out easily.  \n2.The Display is good its 720p, so does the job well.The viewing angles are\ngreat and sunlight legibility is great.Auto Brightness does the job quite\nwell.  \n3.The Speakers are loud this time.With my previous experiences on Mi devices i\nalways wanted a bit of voice from them and finally they got some.  \n4.The camera.Its not in my priority list if 9k is my price range.But i was\nimmensely happy with the camera this time.Image quality is really\nimpressive.Selfie cam is good too.  \n5.Performance is the main ROI and it impresses with that.Nearly no lags in day\nto day usage.Played some light to medium games and they played without any\nflaw.No heating issues as well.  \n6.The battery is something which might be considered as its USP. I almost\npulled 54 hrs on a single charge.Screen on time-6.5 hrs.(approx).The standby\ntime is really impressive and you can now take those long train journeys\nwithout worrying about the charge left.Charging takes 2.5 hrs approx...and yes\nsome dumb people out here are giving 1,2 stars jus coz the battery is heating\nwhile charging.I say them dub maro jaake.Being a 4100mah battery the heating\nis normal every mobile does.Even my Le2 goes around 42 degrees but this phone\ndint went above 41 deg.A sincere Request to such people...kindly research a\nbit before reviewing such...ur 1,2 stars with these absurd issues creates a\ndoubt on future prospect buyers.  \n7.The network reception is really good and there is no issue in this dept.  \n8.There are a few pre installed apps which you have the option to\nuninstall.Even for this somebody reviewed that the apps cant be uninstalled.  \n9.The finger print is flawless.Until sometimes pressing the fingerprint sensor\nlits up the lock screen interface.This happens normally also when you dont set\nfingerprint.But mine happened after setting the fingerprint.And it annoys some\ntimes.  \n10.The frequency of OTA updates is good and its good to know Mi takes care of\ntheir customers.  \nNow thing that I didnt like-  \n1.I am never a big fan of MIUI and i find its interface quite boring.Though\nCustomisation scope is wide but that could cost you more Battery usage and can\nhamper Performance.The icons doesnt have that uniform look and the white\nborders around some icons...looks really disgusting.  \n  \nGo for it if you can pull one from flash sales.The availability on Mi\napps/website is really low.I got it at first try.  \nMy opinion- Purchase the 32GB model with 3gb RAM.With memory card support\n32gigs will never fall short.16GB might not work for long considering the\nupdates size.Nougat update itself might be around 1 GB.The 4GB RAM model with\n64 GB ROM doesnt makes sense to me,considering a new phone launching every day\nI am sure you're not going to stick with it longer than 1-1.5 yrs..Better to\ngo for Redmi note 4 at that price.\n\n", "INTRODUCTION:  \nThis is my third Xiaomi phone after a Mi4i and a Redmi Note 3. Never had any\nissues with the former which I sold off while the latter is still going strong\nnearly a year later. Was pretty sure this one would prove a worthwhile\npurchase as well and it hasn't disappointed so far.  \n  \nBODY:  \nPhone dimensions are 139.2 x 70 x 8.7 mm (5.48 x 2.76 x 0.34 in) and it weighs\nabout 150 grams. Slim shape with curved edges that is comfortable to hold and\neasy to use even with a thick TPU case installed. Like other Redmi phones, it\nposesses a hybrid slim slot meaning the second sim slot can be used for a\nnano-sim or a sd card. Main sim slot is for a micro-sim.  \n  \nDISPLAY:  \n5\" 720 X 1280 IPS panel with a ppi of 294. The screen size is just about right\nfor the resolution. Any bigger and you would be compromising image sharpness\ngiven the smaller resolution. 5.5\" screens are not meant for 720P. Images are\nsharp enough and colors are adequately vibrant. Of course, not as good when\nyou place it side by side with something like a Redmi Note 3 but its a solid\ndisplay nevertheless.  \n  \nHARDWARE:  \nSports a Snapdragon 435 chipset that includes an octa-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A53\nCPU, an Adreno 505 GPU, 2GB RAM and 16GB internal memory. Plenty enough for\nnormal users. Apps load up quickly, most games run smoothly w/o any stutter\nand the general experience is pretty snappy. Not heating issues encountered so\nfar either. Note: If you want to keep more apps in memory or need to the extra\nstorage, go with the 3GB/32GB version.  \n  \nOS/MIUI:  \nRuns Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) out of the box which gets regular OTA updates\nfrom Xiaomi. No Android Nougat yet though. Of course, runs Xiaomi's popular\nMIUI on top of the OS. Even without the app drawer button and no option to\nautomatically sort apps in alphabetical order (you could always install a\nlauncher of your choice from the Play Store), its generally a pleasure to use.\nPlenty of customization options to set up the device the way you want it. Some\ngreat features like Second space, One-handed mode, Quick ball really add to\nthe experience. A great many number of free themes, wallpapers, ringtones and\nfonts are also available for download to drastically change the look of your\nphone.  \n  \nCAMERA:  \n13 MP rear camera with a f/2.0 aperture that has LED flash and autofocus.\nComes with features like touch focus, face/smile detection, HDR, panorama to\nname a few. Picture quality is pretty decent considering the price of the\nphone. Images taken in outdoor conditions are clear and vibrant enough but as\nexpected, shots taken in low light conditions are a bit grainy and lack\ndetail. Can't expect high quality cameras at this price though. Videos are\nrecorded at 1080p@30fps and are of adequate quality. The front camera is 5 MP\nf/2.2 shooter. Good enough to get the job done.  \n  \nFEATURES:  \nComes with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner that is easy to configure and\nquick to respond. Other sensors include accelerometer, gyro, proximity and\ncompass. Also has an IR blaster which is a really handy feature that lets you\ncontrol your TV/STB like you would with a remote.  \n  \nBATTERY:  \nThe gigantic 4100 mAh non-removable battery is one of the strong points of\nthis device. Its way more than enough for the the internal hardware and the\ndisplay size & resolution of this phone. Can easily last more than a day with\nnormal usage.  \n  \nSUMMARY:  \nUnless you're ready to buy used phones, there's probably nothing else you can\npurchase brand new that provides the specs, features and performance the Redmi\n4 does for its asking price. Phones with similar specs from other\nmanufacturers like Samsung, Sony cost much more. Even one of Motorola's\nofferings with similar specs would set you back a few extra grand. The Redmi 4\nsimply cannot be beaten for the price.\n\n", "I had very bad experience with mi 64gb phone... It's been only three weeks\nsince I bought this phone for my mom's birthday... I have good experience with\nthis phone as I already got one for my dad with the same experience I got one\nmore for my mom birthday too.... But on the first day my mom complained phone\ngetting hot when phone is put for charging... I just told my mom phone gets a\nbit heated when put for charging so need not have to worry but she kept on\ntelling the same.. since last week again... As she lives in the remote home\ntown I asked her to give it to me when I visit her this week. She stopped\nusing it till today... Now in the afternoon I have put the phone on charging\nto check the same after an hour when I checked to see if it's true I am.in\nshock my hands are almost burn attached are.picks and I was not even able to\nhold the phone in my hands.... And dropped it to save the heat or the shock\nthat I had when I touched the phone.... I don't know how to take this forward\ncan someone help me on this....first time bad experience with Amazon and MI\n... I have plans to buy one for me this weekend as my father's phone is\nworking great but now thinking what to do...\n\n", "Advantage-  \nPrice is reasonable 9000  \n3gb ram 32 gb storage  \nColour is marvellous... Rose gold, it just look like apple 6s  \nDual app, second space function is awesome  \nBattery backup superb  \nPhones look is awesome  \nSlim even too light weight  \nProcessing speed is good  \nSound quality wow, while using it with earphone it make u feel that you are in\na multiplex  \nIt can be used as remote for a.c, TV, dth  \n  \nDisadvantage -  \nLittle bit hit issues, I am heavy user... If u have to use lightly... It will\nbe fine  \nFront and back Camera both are average  \nIt must be flash on front  \nCharger is too small  \nNo fast charging  \nScreen quality is average\n\n", "Good one.  \nBut left side speaker not working, only right side speaker are working. As per\nattached pic. So now what to do?\n\n", "I purchased 3 GB - 32 GB Variant.  \nGot it on first sale and delivered next day by amazon, great service amazon!\nMy mom is very happy with the product. Premium looks, good performance and\nwith decent battery life.  \nSome points I have mentioned under which can be useful to others if you are\nplanning to buy.  \n  \n1\\. Headphones not comes with the box but you can manage it as in this price\nrange you won't get any other good device with decent configurations like\nthis. Its okay to get a new headset.  \n  \n2\\. Charger cable (USB) is I think too short.  \n  \n3\\. Nice features (MIUI 8) with android 6.  \n  \n4\\. Camera performance is good in day light (outdoors) and in indoor you have\nto use flash for better results.  \n  \n5\\. You can feel cost cutting in sim tray. Very cheap quality, you have to be\ncareful otherwise it can get damaged.  \n  \n6\\. Gaming performance is good enough to play light to mid range games, still\ndidn't tried with heavier games.  \n  \n7\\. Metal body feels good in hand but very smooth so I suggest to use cover\nfor your device so you won't drop it accidentally.  \n  \n8\\. Figerprint sensor works fine, unlocks device in a blink. (Same can be used\nto take selfies)  \n  \n9\\. Sound quality of loudspeaker is good enough.  \n  \n10\\. Battery performance is quite good, normal usage can give you 1 n half day\nof battery life with 4G. If you are a heavy gamer and internet user it may get\ndown.\n\n", "I\u2019d been wanting to move away from iOS for a while and finally decided to take\nthe plunge with the Redmi 4. I figured that it was inexpensive enough that if\nI didn\u2019t like it, it wouldn\u2019t break the bank, and if my clumsy nature kicked\nin and I destroyed it, I could also replace it without having to sell a\nkidney.  \n  \nI\u2019ve got to tell you \u2013 this was the best tech purchase I\u2019ve made in quite a\nwhile. I\u2019ve had it for a little over a month now. Here are my thoughts.  \n  \nThe phone itself is boxed in a manner reminiscent of Apple\u2019s offerings \u2013 clean\nand simple.  \n  \nSetup was a snap \u2013 I just tossed my Sim card in and was ready to go.  \n  \nI was surprised at the build quality of the phone \u2013 it\u2019s very solid. No\ncreaks, no loose seals, no signs that this phone is Rs. 9,499.  \n  \nThe screen is bright and the colors are consistently vivid. Videos play\nsmoothly and pictures really pop.  \n  \nThe phone itself is comfortable in the hand. It\u2019s not so thin that I\u2019m afraid\nthat I\u2019m going to drop it, but it\u2019s not so thick that I\u2019m reminded of the\nearly 80s.  \n  \nThis thing is beautiful! I work at a large tech company surrounded by folks\nwith Samsung's and Apples \u2013 I frequently get compliments about the\nattractiveness of the Redmi 4 and people often express surprise at its low\ncost.  \n  \nIt\u2019s very responsive \u2013 much speedier than my iPhone 6. The finger print reader\nis nearly instantaneous and is exceptionally accurate. The same could not be\nsaid for my former device.  \n  \nTo be honest, and this is a purely subjective statement, it feels snappier\nthan the Galaxy S8\u2019s I play with on occasion.  \n  \nI didn\u2019t like the ROM that it shipped with so I unlocked it and installed\nLineage OS. I\u2019m currently running a beta of version 15 which is based on Oreo\nand I have had no problems with stability or performance. The unlocking\nprocess is weird \u2013 you have to associate your phone with your xiaomi account\nand leave it there for 72 hours before they\u2019ll let you unlock. You have to\nwait the entire 72 hours. No exceptions. Once the time passed, however, the\nprocess to unlock was a couple of mouse clicks on Xiaomi\u2019s software and I was\nready to enter the brave new world of custom ROMs. Since it is cheap I don't\nmind to experiment with it, honestly no hand burn to try something new.  \n  \nThe phone works well on my Airtel 4G. The network support is significantly\nbetter than the 4G LTE I was getting on my iPhone 6.  \n  \nThe battery on this thing is a monster. I have this love of gimmicky stuff and\nhave installed the Paperland live wallpaper. Some friends and co-workers\nadvised me that this would eat my battery for lunch, but I haven\u2019t experienced\nthat. In a typical day of moderate usage I get to about 75% from waking up to\ngoing to bed. The standby battery time is great \u2013 it estimates about 9 days\nwhen I\u2019m doing nothing.  \n  \nIt has a headphone jack, which is a real selling point for me.  \n  \nThe 32 gigs of internal storage is plenty.  \n  \nThe WiFi is stable and doesn\u2019t lose connection ever which is a new experience\nfor me.  \n  \nAll of my different accounts play nice with Android \u2013 which is pleasing.  \n  \nEvery \u201cmust have\u201d app has an Android version \u2013 so there was no real downside\nsoftware wise.  \n  \nThe camera is great \u2013 I haven\u2019t taken any low-light pictures so I can\u2019t really\ncomment on that, but videos and pics in average lighting are clear and\nartifact free.  \n  \nThe gripes I have are minor.  \n  \nThe headphone jack placement on the top of the phone makes pulling it out of\nmy pocket and using the phone awkward.  \n  \nMy palm at the lower part of my thumb (there\u2019s probably a word for that)\ntouches the screen when I\u2019m reaching for far away icons, this essentially\nkills the screen for any other taps. That\u2019s taken some getting used to.  \n  \nThere is no \u201cdouble tap\u201d on the home button to drop the top-most icons to a\nmore reachable area.  \n  \nThe speaker sucks \u2013 but I use headphones so that\u2019s not a super big issue.  \n  \nIt doesn\u2019t have wireless charging, which I kind of want now. For the price I\ncan\u2019t really expect that feature, though.  \n  \nI still haven\u2019t found the perfect keyboard.  \n  \nIn conclusion \u2013 this is an excellent phone at an excellent price. I was\nworried about compatibility with the services that I use but that hasn\u2019t\nturned out to be a problem. The phone is cheap enough that if I lose it or\ndrop it in a pool I can easily replace it without having to sell a kidney.\nIt\u2019s immensely customizable \u2013 that honestly wasn\u2019t something I realized I\nwanted until I had the option (now I\u2019ve got live wall papers and a custom icon\nset.) I was worried about updates, but custom roms fixed that.  \n  \nI would highly recommend this phone to anyone wanting to try out Android on a\ndevice that\u2019s not going to break the bank. It\u2019s far exceeded my expectations\nin terms of quality and responsiveness \u2013 I feel no need to upgrade to a\n\u201cflagship\u201d phone to make up for the very few shortcomings of the device.  \n  \nXaiomi has made a fantastic phone at a very reasonable price and I\u2019m going to\nbe buying more of their stuff.\n\n", "Hi guys this is my honest review.  \n  \n1st of all if u here are lots of reviews complaint about heating issue.  \nLet me tell u . Its just totally normal yr. Yes it get little warm during\ncharging and heavy gaming but thats ok. Its not heating like it will hurt ur\nplam or due to heating ur phone hurting itself. Or there is no problem on\nbattery or processor performance. So guys dont ignore this phone due to\nheating issue. My previous phone moto g4 heats a lot more than this but i\nnever face any problem. And if u use a back cover , u even didn't notice it\never. So guys Heating is not a issue. Dont be fool by negative reviews. Go for\nit.  \n  \nBut here is one thing that i personal didn't like.  \nThe 2.5 curve glass on front scree.  \n  \nYes u can blame me for that. But let me tell u hidden truth.  \nDue to that curve it looks amazing and awesome on feel when u hold it on hand.\nBut as u know redmi 4 didn't comes with horilla glass protection. So it is\nmandatory to apply tempered glass.  \nAnd here is problem. Due to 2.5 curve u will never ever got a screen guard\nthat fit and cover edge to edge on whole front screen. If u shop glass on\napply it will still leaving some space (space ubove that curve) on all sides\n.and thats totaal ruined the beauty of phone. Yes therir are full front glass\navailable on amazon which fits perfectly on screen but it is too costly yr. I\nmean it is unfair to buy front glass of rs 250 where ur old phone will easily\nget glass of 100 rs anywhere. And thats bcoz of 2.5 d curve .  \n  \nAnyway other specifications are as always as awesome in Redmi phones.  \n\\- Processor is masterstock. I found it perform flawlessly. Even gaming is\ngrate experience in this phone.  \n\\- go for 3gb model if u afford bcoz redmi UI has lots of pre install apps\nthat cant be disable or remove. And out of 3 gb , 1.5 ram is continuously used\nat any time. But it enough for heavy use or any multitasking . So ram is not\nan issue.  \n\\- battery is again a masterstock. I never see any other battery which\ncompeting redmi 4. Even it lasts more than redmi note 4 battery.  \n-camara : yup this is department where i found redmi has been little compromised. Although camera is good and better than note 3 but it is not for camera lovers fan. Daylight pic are really really good. Low light are average. Selfi camera is average. Back camera is good. But overall its good camera phone considering the budget. (Go for coolpad cool 1 or honer 6x if u r huge camera lover)  \n-back is little slippery  \n\\- display looks sharpe and good colour production  \n\\- touch button doesn't have blacklight like note 4  \n\\- IR blaster is the advantage to control tv ,AC etc  \n\\- i like the placemant of speaker (bottom) and fingerprint (back) .  \n-no earphones provided which extends ur budget by 500 rs if u buy form outside  \n-no fast charging .(Like my old moto g4 turbo chargering) total charge in 2 hr 40 min  \n  \nok frnds. So my suggestion is go for this. Its best budget plus perfomance\npacked phone.  \nIf ur not redmi fan then Other competitors are lenovo k6 power, samsung j5,\ncoolpad cool 1, le.\n\n", "KEY HIGHLIGHTS~  \nThree variants of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 have been launched in India  \nOverall performance of the device is decent  \nGadgets 360 rates the phone 8 out of 10  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 is the company's latest model in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment.\nUnlike premium smartphones, budget phones seem to have shorter life cycles,\nand the Redmi series is the perfect example of this. The Xiaomi Redmi 3S (and\nRedmi 3S Prime) launched in India in August last year, and the company claims\nthat they are the highest selling smartphones in the online segment, having\nsold four million units in just nine months. Despite this, the all-new Xiaomi\nRedmi 4 will soon replace the popular Redmi 3S (and Redmi 3S Prime).  \n  \nXiaomi has so far seen a string of successes with its Redmi range, with most\nmodels finding place in our periodic lists of the best budget phones. This new\nXiaomi Redmi 4 will not only have to take on the competition, but also live up\nto its predecessor in a lot of ways, and it certainly seems like an\nimprovement when it comes to specifications. Let's find out whether the phone\nis worth your time and money in our Xiaomi Redmi 4 review:  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 design  \n  \nWhen the Redmi 4 arrived at our office for the first time, we mistook it for a\n'Lite' or smaller variant of the Redmi Note 4. You can see plenty of design\nsimilarities between the two. Jai Mani, Lead Product Manager at Xiaomi told\nGadgets 360 at a pre-launch briefing that the Redmi 4's looks are consciously\nmore in sync with the bigger Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review). The all-metal back\nof the Redmi 4 is polished and makes this phone look more premium than its\npredecessor. However, it makes the phone slightly slippery, and we nearly\ndropped it a couple of times while trying to take photos during the review\nperiod.  \n  \nThere has not been much change to the basic Redmi formula. Much like the Redmi\n3S, the Redmi 4 features a 5-inch screen. The new model, however, is slightly\nthicker at 8.65mm and heavier at 150 grams. The Redmi 3S measured 8.5mm and\nweighed at 144 grams. Overall the increase in thickness or weight doesn't\nchange much for the Redmi 4 as the phone is still quite usable with just one\nhand, and in fact fits better in the hand than the outgoing model.  \nWe had no problem reaching the Redmi 4 fingerprint sensor at any time. The\nphone has only one Mi logo on the rear, but there's also a \"Designed by Xiaomi\n/ Assembled in India\" statement embossed in tiny letters. We like the\nattention detail, such as a protective ring around the camera lens.  \n  \nThe power and volume buttons are on the right, and are easily accessible when\nusing the phone with just one hand. There is a Micro-USB port for charging and\ndata transfers on the bottom, with grilles on either side, though only one of\nthem is actually a speaker. The 3.5mm audio socket and an Infrared emitter can\nbe found on the top.  \n  \nRedmi 4's navigation buttons are placed right below the screen but they aren't\nbacklit, which means locating them in the dark is tough.The notification LED\nis right below the Home button and is bright enough to alert users about\nincoming notifications. Much like other Redmi smartphones, the new Redmi 4\nalso has a hybrid dual-SIM tray, which means that you will have to decide\nwhether to use two SIM cards or one SIM along with a microSD card. The Redmi 4\nwill be available in Champagne Gold and Matte Black, and we received the\nlatter for the review.  \n  \nYou get standard set of documents, a data cable, a power adaptor, and a SIM\nejector tool along with the phone itself in the retail box.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 specifications and software  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 features a 5-inch HD (720x1280) IPS display with 2.5D curved-\nedge glass. This seems to be the first time that Xiaomi is using 2.5D glass on\na Redmi smartphone priced below Rs. 10,000. There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery, and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. The phone is powered by an octa-\ncore Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. There are three\nvariants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; one with 3GB\nof RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. Our\nreview unit had 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports\nexpandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).  \n  \nYou get a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED\nflash. There's also a 5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. The new\nRedmi 4 will support 4G and VoLTE along with other connectivity options. When\ntwo SIM cards are used, only the primary one will allow 4G calls and data\nwhile the secondary SIM falls back to 2G calls only.  \nThe phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with Xiaomi's MIUI 8.2 skin. This\nis a stable build which is identical to what we saw on the Redmi Note 4 and\nRedmi 4A. This means that the Redmi 4 has a lot of software features that we\nhave already seen, including Dual Apps, which lets you create a second\ninstance of any app and supports Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and\nmore. The Quick Ball feature lets users assign shortcuts for features. One-\nhanded mode shrinks the display to one corner of the screen so that\neverything's easier to reach. The phone also gets a scrolling screenshot\nfeature that will let you take screenshot of an entire Web page. Child Mode\nlets users lock apps, and Second Space creates a separate profile to help\nusers manage business and personal data on the same device.  \n  \nThis version of MIUI looks cleaner and more polished than previous versions.\nYou can read about the software in more detail in our reviews of the Xiaomi\nRedmi Note 4 and Xiaomi Redmi 4A.  \n  \nIn keeping with previous Redmi phones, the Redmi 4 also packs lots of\npreinstalled apps such as Music, Mi Picks, Mi Community, News, Security,\nNotes, Recorder, and Weather. The Themes app lets users select themes,\nwallpapers, ringtones, and fonts from a store. There's also a dedicated Mi\nStore app on the device through which users can buy Xiaomi products and\naccessories. We believe that the MIUI interface could become lighter with the\nremoval of some of this bloatware, but not all of them can be deleted and they\ntake up valuable storage space on the device. There are also some preinstalled\nthird-party apps including Amazon, PhonePe Wallet, Flipkart, Facebook, and\nSwiftKey.  \n  \nUsers will get up to 5GB of free Mi Cloud storage when they sign in with a Mi\naccount, which is additional to the 15GB of free cloud storage that's offered\nby Google with every Gmail sign-in  \nWe were disappointed to see that the Redmi 4 does not run Android 7.0 Nougat,\nnor did it support Google Assistant at the time of review. On long-pressing\nthe home button, the Now on Tap feature for context-based searches is\ntriggered. Xiaomi says that the Redmi 4 will receiving an update to Nougat,\nand we might get Google Assistant before that, but no timeline has been\npromised by the company.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 camera  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy. Compared to the Redmi 3S Prime, we found that\nautofocus on the Redmi 4 was a bit quicker. Camera samples were detailed and\nsharp, with colours that were vibrant and truly popped. Landscapes had\naccurate colours for the most part as well as reasonable detail. Macro or\nclose-up shots had a slight haze when seen full-size on a desktop monitor,\nthough the HDR mode helped to some extent.  \n  \nUnfortunately, turning HDR mode on made image capturing and processing really\nslow, and this is one of our biggest complaints with the device. With HDR on,\nusers need to be steady for a few seconds to get a good shot, or else photos\ncome out looking awful.  \n  \nThe rear camera has a tendency to capture a lot of noise when there is no\ndirect light source. Some camera sample shots taken in the dark were very\npoorly defined and had too much motion blur. At night, the Redmi 4 managed to\ntake good photos only when we were close to the subject under a light source\nsuch as a streetlamp.  \nThe Redmi 4's camera app is minimalistic and easy to use, with controls for\nvarious settings and features occupying only a small part of the screen. HDR\nmode is just a tap away, as are the live filters. The phone can record video\nat 720p and 1080p, and the videos came out decent overall.  \n  \nSelfies on the Redmi 4 can be an issue if you want a candid one, again because\nimage processing is slow. We ended up with a slew of blurred selfies just\nbecause we wanted to take one quickly. Other than this issue, our sample\nphotos taken in good light had a good amount of detail and decent colour tone.\nIn low light, we had a tough time, and faces came out looking too grainy.  \n  \nOverall, the Xiaomi Redmi 4's cameras are definitely an improvement over those\nof the Redmi 3S Prime (Review), in terms of focusing and results. There are\nfew issues like poor low-light shots and slow processing in HDR mode, which we\nhope can be fixed - or at least improved upon - with updates.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 performance  \n  \nGeneral performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is decent, and the device handled\nmost tasks well. The MIUI interface at times felt sluggish, but this doesn't\naffect performance within apps such as when playing games such as Asphalt 8\nand Cut the Rope 2. We had no major concerns during the entire review period.\nThere was also no noticeable overheating.  \n  \nOur unit had 3GB of RAM, and there was roughly 1.2GB free at any given time,\nwhich means those on the 2GB RAM variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 might struggle\nwith multi-tasking on their units. Despite roughly 1GB of free memory on our\nunit, we didn't have to deal with any crashes or slowdowns, but we would\nrecommend opting for the variant with 4GB of RAM if you can spend a little\nmore.  \n  \nVoice call quality was decent, and the phone supports VoLTE. The phone doesn't\nship with a headset, so we checked the sound quality using our own earphones,\nand were quite impressed. You get several options to tweak music with the Mi\nSound Enhancer feature when using earphones. The Redmi 4 was also able to play\nour assortment of test videos with ease.  \nThe 5-inch IPS display is bright and text appears sharp. The screen is crisp\nwith decent viewing angles. However, this isn't the best HD display we've seen\non a Redmi phone. Colour reproduction is decent, but in our opinion, the Redmi\n3S was better. The screen was readable and usable under direct sunlight.\nMovies and games look good on the 5-inch display, though some might prefer a\nbigger screen. There's a Reading mode on the device that reduces background\nglare. Users can manually control colours and saturation on the device through\nthe Settings app.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 scored 43,677 in AnTuTu and 22,996 in Quadrant. We also ran\n3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench, where the phone scored 5,890 points and\n25fps respectively. These scores are on par with those of other phones powered\nby the Snapdragon 430 processor.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 lasted for 14 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test,\nwhich is impressive. We can partly credit the battery loop test performance to\nthe low-impact HD screen resolution. With regular use, the battery lasted over\na day. There are also power saving modes to help squeeze more life out of each\ncharge. The phone doesn't come with a fast charging adapter but Xiaomi's Jai\nMani told us that it does support fast charging. We can expect Xiaomi to sell\na fast charging adapter for the Redmi 4 as an optional accessory, or you could\nbuy a third-party one.  \n  \nVerdict  \nIn the past, Xiaomi's Redmi models have set the standard for other phones in\nthe same price segment, and have also showed just how much a budget smartphone\ncan be capable of. The same holds true for the all-new Redmi 4. Xiaomi's\nlatest entry in the Redmi range manages to tick all the right boxes when it\ncomes to performance, battery life, and design. Camera quality is one aspect\nof performance that this phone lacks in, but then again we can't expect too\nmuch at these prices.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 will replace the Redmi 3S (and Redmi 3S Prime) over time,\nand will become the company's main offering in the sub-Rs. 10,000 space. It\nhas launched at Rs. 6,999 for 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; Rs. 8,999 for\n3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage; and Rs. 10,999 for 4GB RAM of and 64GB of\nstorage. Considering that the middle version, which we reviewed, had roughly\n1.2GB of memory free at any time, we would recommend that people to go for the\nslightly more expensive one if they can. The Redmi 4 goes up against the\nSamsung Galaxy J2 (2016), Lenovo K6 Power (Review), and Oppo A37, but its\nbiggest challenger might be Xiaomi's own Redmi Note 4 which offers a better\nSoC, a bigger screen, and an improved set of cameras.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 28 May 2017", "on 12 July 2017", "on 18 July 2017", "on 30 July 2017", "on 18 July 2017", "on 30 August 2017", "on 2 June 2017", "on 17 October 2017", "on 2 June 2017", "on 20 March 2018"], "reviewer": ["Sameer Patil", "Allen", "XenolithicYardZone", "Amazon Customer", "Gaurav Pratap Singh", "Amazon Customer", "Yogesh", "SwordFish", "Amazon Customer", "Sourav Dey"]},

I\ntargeted the Rs. 6998 variant, but that was too hard to get. So I bought the\nRs. 8998 variant instead which has got 3GB RAM & 32GB ROM unlike the former\nwhich has got 2GB RAM & 16GB ROM.  \nI thought of making a detailed review of the phone after using it for 2.5\nweeks.  \n  \nBODY  \nThe screen is NOT of Gorilla Glass. Many of the reviews on Youtube claim it to\nbe. But it isn't. The rest of the body is a metal one except the upper and\nlower division at the back which is of poly-carbonate. The right grill at the\nbottom is for speaker and left grill for microphone. I would suggest to buy a\nback cover (I prefer a transparent one) to protect its body.  \n  \nHARDWARE  \nIt comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor with a clock speed\nof 1.4 GHz and an Adreno 505 GPU. The 3 GB RAM does a good job (not excellent)\nwhen it comes to multi tasking.  \n  \nSOFTWARE  \nIt comes preloaded with MiUI 8 which is a very simple UI. I expected an\nAndroid 7 Nougat. But it's alright not to have it.  \n  \nSTORAGE  \nYou get only 25.85 GB of internal storage out of 32 GB. It shoots down to 21\nGB after you install the essential applications. So it's better than the 16 GB\nvariant any day. It is good that I didn't get hold of the 16 GB variant. :P  \n  \nBATTERY  \nIt packs in with a 4100 mAh battery which does a good job to keep the lights\non. Moderate use will give you approximately 28-30 hrs of backup. Heavy use\nwill give you 16-18 hrs.  \n  \nDISPLAY  \nWith a 5\" 720p HD display, the colours come out pretty well. Nothing to\ncomplain about. It is better to buy a good tempered glass to protect the\nscreen as it is not of Gorilla Glass.  \n  \nCAMERA  \nThe rear camera is of 13 mp which performs very well under daylight, whereas\nit gives grainy images under moderate artificial lighting conditions. It has\ngot touch focus and auto focus.  \nThe front camera is of 5 mp and can deliver decent photos though it doesn't\nhave auto or touch focus.  \nThe Full HD video on the rear camera surprised me. Go check it out for\nyourself.  \n  \nCALLING  \nThe voice reception of the receiving end speaker and the microphone are pretty\ngood while calling. You can auto record calls or record them manually.  \n  \nREAR SPEAKER & MICROPHONE  \nPersonally I didn't like the microphone that much. It is average; just because\nthe sound captured gives too much treble when listened to.  \nWhereas the speaker is pretty good.  \n  \nISSUES  \n1\\. The phone heats up like an oven with moderate use; especially when you are\ngaming or it is on charge.  \n2\\. I did not quite like the RAM management. Instagram suffered a hang once.\nAsphalt 8 also lags a lot when you glide through the Menu and Data is switched\non. Anyway, it runs smooth while gaming.  \n3\\. The notification light is a mono coloured one(white). Even the Redmi 3s\nhas a multi coloured notification light.  \n  \nVERDICT  \nKeeping aside the drawbacks I would say that the Redmi 4 is a must buy if you\nare thinking of buying a smart phone for the first time. It's better to go for\nthe 3Gb 32Gb variant. But anyway you won't be at a loss if you buy the entry\nlevel one (2Gb 16GB). The most interesting part of all is that it is Made In\nIndia.\n\n", "I am really upset after buying this phone , consistently hangup problem and it\ngets auto restart again and again. Fully charged phone gets drained battery\novernight due to auto restart issue (every 15 mins). Actually I used this\nphone as a second phone that's why I kept on avoiding the issue and didnt\nreport the issue. but now this problem is so Persistent that I thought of\nwriting the review to understand if the company is responsive about it or not,\nsharing screen shot of 28August and an one recent. One of my colleagues\nsuggested that delete the dual profile as might not support that feature\neffectively, so I did the same but this phone is keep me busy frustrating.  \nI hope this is a set specific issue not getting faced by other users. Let's\nsee the response from team.\n\n", "Hello,  \nI am writing this review after 15 days usage of my Redmi 4 (3+32gb). I have\nsome other phones like Lenovo Z2 Plus, Lenovo P2, Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime, and\nMoto G4 Plus so I can better understand the differences between these phones.  \nSo I will start from scratch so that I can help you guys who are confused in\nbuying a new phone.  \nHere we divide its specs in groups as 1. Design and build, 2. Display, 3.\nProcessor and performance, 4. Battery, 5. Camera, 6. Other hardware(e.g.\nFingerprint and other sensors), 7. Software, 8. Pros and cons, 9. Verdict,\n10.Other phones you should consider  \nand I will also rate each group in a scale of 10.  \nSo let's start-----  \n1\\. Design and build:- Design is a strong defender of this phone. It is quiet\nsleek and compact. It is made of metal but not as solid as Samsung J7 Prime\nand Lenovo P2. When you hold this phone, you will feel a little premium.\nBezels is not irritating. I will give design and build 8 out of 10.  \n  \n2\\. Display:- Display is beautiful. It produces colors nicely but it is not\ngood as Lenovo P2(super amoled) and Moto G4. Sometimes colors seem over\nsaturated like Samsung J7 Prime. Overall display quality is satisfying and I\nwill give it 7 out of 10.  \n  \n3\\. Processor and performance:- Here comes the heart of a phone. It has\nSnapdragon 435 which is an octa-core processor but it runs in low frequency\ni.e. 1.4 Ghz. Although it does your all day-to-day work and some gaming also.\nI run Asphalt 8 and CSR Racing2 in it and it works fine but not so great. So\nit is okay for general use and light gaming. It does not heat in general work\nbut you can feel heat after 25-30 minutes of gaming. Here I will give 8.5 out\nof 10.  \n  \n4\\. Battery:- Though it has 4100 mah battery in papers but it does not deliver\nthat great backup. If you use it generally, you will get a full day backup\nwith 10-15% battery left. Whereas my Lenovo P2 with 5000mah battery lasts for\n3 days normally, and Lenovo Z2 plus with 3300 mah battery lasts for 1.5 days,\nand samsung j7 prime and moto g4 with around 3000 mah battery also last for\n1.5 days. So I think the quality of battery is not so good. It only has\nquantity not quality. So I will give battery 7 out of 10.  \n  \n5\\. Camera:- Here is the weakest part of this phone. Camera of this phone is\nvery bad yar. It captures average images in daylight. In low light it is very\nbad and in artificial lighting too. Even I can not compare this with my other\nphones because they have far better cameras than that of Redmi 4. There are\nsome suggestions below for a better phone in this price range. So I will give\n6 out of 10 to the camera.  \n  \n6\\. Other hardware:- It has a quick fingerprint which works well. Other\nsensors like compass, accelerometer, light sensor are included but not\nGyroscope. So you can't use it in a VR box. It also has an infrared sensor to\ncontrol your other appliances. I will give its fingerprint 9 out of 10.  \n  \n7\\. Software:- I will directly give it 7 out of 10. This is enough to\nindicate.  \n  \n8\\. Pros and cons:- First we will take Pros which I feel are advantages over\nother phones I am using----  \nA. It is a thin and compact device, thanks to its 5\" display.  \nB. Fast fingerprint  \nC. Speaker is good.  \nD. Good performance  \nF. No bloatware in software  \nG. Good display  \n  \nMoving to the cons of the phone-----  \nA. Camera is very bad  \nB. No Gyroscope sensor  \nC. Battery backup is not good as 4100mah  \nD. Navigation keys are not backlit  \n  \n10\\. Verdict:- If I will tell it in one line then it will be \" A good phone\nfor general tasks without taking photos.\" It is a good phone if you want a\nphone for day-to-day use and not fond of taking pictures. You will neither be\nimpressed nor frustrated.  \n  \n11\\. Other phones to be considered:- So here I have got some other phones in\nthe price range of 9000-13000. Below are there brief descriptions and links of\nAmazon and Flipkart with best available prices...  \nA. Lenovo P2-- A powerhouse of performance and battery with super amoled\ndisplay @just 13000rs.

Xiaomi Redmi 4 price in India\nstarts from Rs. 10,999. As its coupled with the marvelous price tag.  \nIts just powered by 1.4GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor and is\nsupported with 3GB of RAM Random Access Memory. The phone housed with 32GB of\ninternal storage that can be expanded up to 128GB via a microSD card. As per\nwith the cameras department, it has 13MP-megapixel primary camera by the rear\nand a 5MP-megapixel front selfies shot.  \nAlso it runs on Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 over with the latest MIUI ver. and\nis fuelled with 4100mAh in-build attached. It sized at 139.30 high x 69.90\nwide x 8.65 thicker and weighted at 150 grams.  \nAs its coupled with dual GSM SIM also smartphone that accepts Micro-SIM and\nNano-SIM alternatively.  \nConnectivity include  \nWi-Fi,  \nGPS,  \nBluetooth,  \nInfrared,  \nUSB OTG,  \nFM,  \n3G and 4G.  \nSensors on the phone include  \nCompass/Magnetometer,  \nProximity sensor,  \nAccelerometer,  \nAmbient light sensor and  \nGyroscope.  \n  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\ud83d\udce5 Box Content\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude4a  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n# A smartphone.  \n# A wall chaging adapter over with 2 Amp. current output.  \n# 1.2m USB to Micro USB Cable.  \n  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\ud83d\udc4d Lets see the Pros\ud83e\udd14  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n# Good build quality  \n# Compact body  \n# Solid battery performance  \n# Excellent value for money  \n  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\ud83d\udc4e What would be the Cons\ud83e\udd14  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n# Average camera performance  \n# Hybrid dual-SIM  \n# Limited availability  \n  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\ud83d\udde8 Verdict\ud83d\udc42  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nOne big ques. remain the double over with the processor. As the Redmi 3S has\nthe Snapdragon 430 and the Redmi 4 has Snapdragon 435. Then also the benchmark\nis greater in Redmi 3S as compared with Redmi 4.  \nBut, still it coupled with great extra and aditional feature which is far more\nbetter tha the previous models (i.e.,Redmi 3S).  \n  \nWas my review helpful to you? Do Judge.\n\n", "Redmi 4, is almost near to the phones double than its price.  \nThis is One of the Best Xiaomi Phones till Date.  \n(First lil complaints and reviews after that)  \n  \nFlash sales, too stressful, Xiaomi don't treat us like this, please.  \n  \nAnd Amazon why do you send products through India Post?? it took one week to\ndeliver,  \nwhereas other courier services send within 2-3 days. Package had also become\nshabby.  \n(But won't review the device based on your service)  \n  \nNow let's come to the phone.  \nI ordered the \"Black 3GB 32GB\" variant, somehow got in flash sale after\ngetting into waitlist.  \n  \nFirst Looks: Full Premium Device, Matte black finish, 2.5D curved glass,\nfinger print scanner.  \n  \nThe Phone is really charming, feels so comfortable in hands, perfect weight\nand dimensions.  \nI was going to buy Redmi Note 4 but opted this one for its handy size and this\nwas one of the reasons I admired the iPhones  \n(as a bonus this devices feels like the latest iPhones 6 7 etc)  \n  \nDisplay is Really Good.  \nAudio quality is Nice and Loud!  \nBeing a music lover, I'm in awe of the music playback.  \nCamera performance is poor in low light as expected, anyway who needs HD pics\nin lowlight?  \nOutdoors performance is nice.  \n  \nFingerprint scanner is really quick.  \n  \nFull charge within 3hrs approx, not bad for 4100mAh right?  \n  \nOne shocking thing was Single Colored LED(only white ) Notification, why this\ndowngrade Xiaomi?  \nWas it for cost cutting? Will it be fixed in further updates?  \n  \nCharger adapter is very small & cute, but the wire is little thinner and small\nin length as compared to that of RNote4 etc. Again, Cost Cutting Xiaomi? How\nmuch did you save?  \n  \nAs usual Xiaomi never gives earphones, only USB cord, charging adapter and\nuser manual.  \nSo, buy any product only after researching thoroughly.  \n  \nOverall I am happy with this phone, looks are amazing a treat to my eyes,\nfeels great in hands, performing smoothly, camera is sufficient, battery is\nhuge enough to last for a whole day of usage, 9K me isse zyada or kya chahiye,\niPhone chahiye kya?  \n  \nPaisa Vasool Product, just hope further experience will be good without any\nissues.  \n  \nHope my review helped you, if yes then press 'Helpful'  \nOr comment for further queries.  \n  \nExtra points for Photographers:  \nDon't buy this phone for a Great Camera, at this budget Camera shouldn't be\nyour priority, but Battery and all the points I explained above.  \nInstead of buying phones above 20K you can buy this one, save money and buy a\nDSLR instead.\n\n", "Redmi 4 (Dark Grey, 64GB)  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi Note 4, the successor to the popular Redmi Note 3, is the first\nsmartphone by the Chinese company for the Indian market in 2017.  \nI purchased it for \u20b912,999 and thought that device worth it.  \nIt comes with Android Marshmallow out of box but in this November Android\nNougat and MIUI 9 Global Stable Update is coming.  \n  \nAFTER 1 YEAR:  \n\\- Color from back plate start getting out of it.  \n\\- Battery Life decreases (Little bit).  \n\\- No change in Performance.  \n\\- Start Heating Little bit.  \n  \n======================================================================================  \nPros:  \n\\- Multitasking feature added in MIUI 9 (GLOBAL UPDATE)  \n\\- Rear Camera can record 4K @ 30fps but the software can't support.  \n\\- Very Good voice recording due to decent noise cancellation.  \n\\- HIGH END MID RANGE SMART PHONE.  \n\\- Both the primary and secondary optics captures pretty decent images even in\nlow light conditions.

So if you want to buy a good specs phone with medium\nsize display, long battery life and good camera than go for Redmi 4  \n  \n\\--> IF YOU ARE A HEAVY USER THEN I WON'T PERSONALLY RECOMMEND IT  \n  \n\\--> IF YOU ARE A USER LOOKING FOR LONG BATTERY LIFE AND GOOD CALLING\nEXPERIENCE THEN JUST GO FOR IT  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n", "Update 25-03-2018  \nAlthough we all have faced many problems and have been compromising because of\nthe price we have paid, my phone however has gone to infinite bootloop and now\nI must wipe all data to recover this stupid Chinese phone with all the useless\nfeatures of a nasty custom os called MiUi.  \n  \n\\------------------------------------Archived---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nUsing for few days. I have ran necessary tests to check hardware components.\nIt has compass and step counter sensors. One speaker and one mic at the\nbottom. I can't say it's the right placement, maybe because I place my little\nfinger at the bottom of the phone while holding in one hand and this get worse\nwhen you're listening to some songs without the headphones.  \n  \nDefault UI is fine but I use smart luncher pro 3 which is better. I've heard\nof heating issues but haven't faced any yet even while playing Nova. Minor\nsoftware bugs related to changing wallpaper which is not possible without\nchanging to default MiUI launcher. Also few bugs while synching accounts but\napps are running perfectly, no problems. Bloatwares can be easily and\ncompletely uninstalled.  \n  \nThere are a lot of small details* to observe thanks to the MiUI fork of\nAndroid; I see that's why you don't get the android 7 update yet for stability\npurposes.  \n  \n*Note and record apps are inbuilt with phone app which is extremely important when you're on a call and want to note or record something.  \n*Weather (uses accuweather) animation on notification palate, very lovely.  \n*special settings for battery and data analysis, again very colourful  \n*SwiftKey is in built which I always use  \n*notification toggle positions with integrated pallette makes it more efficient, you won't have to waste time opening settings page also while adjusting brightness the whole notification palette disappears leaving you on current screen. They have a special reading mode as well.  \n  \nCharging takes two and half hours. I've used original mi hard case and screen\nguard which are not very good rather made it more vulnerable as they are\nfrictionless.

There are curved edges with a curved 2.5D glass on the front\nwhich aids the ergonomics. The highlight of the design is of course the\ncompact form factor owing to the 5-inch display. It fits quite well in one\u2019s\npalms and single-handed usage is a breeze.  \n  \nThe build quality is excellent and it feels solid, and the matte black variant\nlooks great and gives a very premium feel.  \n  \nHowever, the three capacitive buttons behind the display are not backlit. It\nis disorienting at first, but you impulsively know where your thumb needs to\ngo after a few days of usage.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 might be a budget phone but there\u2019s no compromise on the\naesthetics. In fact, with this outing \u2013 like before \u2013 the company sets the\nstandards for what affordable smartphones should look and feel like in 2017.  \n  \nDisplay  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 sports a 5-inch HD display with a 1280 x 720 resolution. There\u2019s a\n2.5D curved glass, similar to the Redmi Note 4. It\u2019s toughened glass, although\nthere\u2019s no Gorilla Glass protection.  \n  \nWhile the specifications sheet watchers would\u2019ve liked a Full HD display, I\nthink it would\u2019ve been an overkill on a 5-inch budget smartphone and obviously\nhurt the battery life.  \n  \nThe HD display nevertheless looks fantastic in terms of color reproduction and\nviewing angles. The images and text looks sharp, and it is clearly one of the\nbest displays on smartphones in this price segment. Maintaining a perfect\nbalance, it is a crisp and vivid display without the colors looking\noversaturated.  \n  \nPerformance  \n  \nPowered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz\ncoupled with Adreno 505 GPU, the Redmi 4 comes in three memory variants \u2013\nthere\u2019s one with 2 GB RAM and 16 GB internal storage, another one with 3 GB of\nRAM along with 32 GB of storage, and the top variant with 4 GB of RAM and 64\nGB of internal storage.  \n  \nThe mid variant that I used for this review had just over 25 GB free memory\nout-of-the box.  \n  \nThe Snapdragon 435 is a pretty snappy chip, and the Redmi 4 chugs along nicely\nin daily usage. In my three weeks of usage, I haven\u2019t really encountered any\nsluggishness or lags. You can also play most of the graphic-intensive games,\nalbeit with a few frame skips here and there or graphic settings turned down.\nOne of the impressive things is that even while gaming, the phone did not get\nhot.  \n  \nThe 4,100 mAh battery on the Redmi 4 saves you from the constant battery\nanxiety. A day and a half on a single charge is easily manageable for most\ncasual users which is impressive really. Even on moderate to higher usage, the\nphone managed to offer more than a day of battery life.  \n  \nHardware  \n  \nJust like the Redmi Note 4, the Redmi 4 packs in an IR blaster that you can\nconfigure to use your phone as a remote control for several electronic\nappliances at your home. The fingerprint scanner located at the back is quite\ngood, and apart from authentication, can also be used to take photos,\nespecially those selfies.  \n  \nThe dual SIM smartphone features a hybrid slot, so essentially, you can either\nuse two SIM cards or one SIM card and one microSD card. If you need to use two\nSIMs and are a content hog, maybe you\u2019d like to opt for the top variant that\noffers 64 GB internal storage.  \n  \nWhile the battery life on the Redmi 4 is stellar, it is disappointing that\nthere is no fast charging support on the device. The issue is magnified in\nphones which pack in larger batteries because it takes even longer to charge\nthe phone completely.  \n  \nCamera  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 packs a 13MP rear camera with LED flash that can manage some\ngreat shots with good color reproduction and sharpness.  \n  \nOutdoors in daylight, the phone really surprises with details it manages to\ncapture and overall clarity. Even the macro shots and close-up portraits turn\nout to be great. The PDAF works quite well and the camera focuses on subjects\nin a snap.  \n  \nIn low light, the camera manages to click some decent shots, but there\u2019s a lot\nof noise in the pictures. Even indoors, the photos take a hit and are average\nat best. But this is a budget smartphone we\u2019re talking about and it does\nbetter than what most in this segment manage to achieve.  \n  \nXiaomi deserves credit for its impressive camera algorithms that makes the\nRedmi 4 a fast and dependable shooter.  \n  \nThe 5-megapixel front-facing camera manages decent selfies that are good\nenough for social sharing. There\u2019s nothing special there, although most would\nnot expect that anyway.  \n  \nI thought that there is no mobile ever made till now just like it in such low\nprice.\n\n", "Nice product with 3gb Ram.

This seems to be the first time that Xiaomi is using 2.5D glass on\na Redmi smartphone priced below Rs. 10,000. There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery, and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. The phone is powered by an octa-\ncore Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. There are three\nvariants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; one with 3GB\nof RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. Our\nreview unit had 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports\nexpandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).You get a 13-megapixel\nrear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED flash. There's also a\n5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. The new Redmi 4 will support 4G\nand VoLTE along with other connectivity options. When two SIM cards are used,\nonly the primary one will allow 4G calls and data while the secondary SIM\nfalls back to 2G calls only.The phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with\nXiaomi's MIUI 8.2 skin. This is a stable build which is identical to what we\nsaw on the Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4A. This means that the Redmi 4 has a lot of\nsoftware features that we have already seen, including Dual Apps, which lets\nyou create a second instance of any app and supports Facebook, Instagram,\nTwitter, WhatsApp, and more. The Quick Ball feature lets users assign\nshortcuts for features. One-handed mode shrinks the display to one corner of\nthe screen so that everything's easier to reach. The phone also gets a\nscrolling screenshot feature that will let you take screenshot of an entire\nWeb page. Child Mode lets users lock apps, and Second Space creates a separate\nprofile to help users manage business and personal data on the same device.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 camera  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy. Compared to the Redmi 3S Prime, we found that\nautofocus on the Redmi 4 was a bit quicker. Camera samples were detailed and\nsharp, with colours that were vibrant and truly popped. Landscapes had\naccurate colours for the most part as well as reasonable detail. Macro or\nclose-up shots had a slight haze when seen full-size on a desktop monitor,\nthough the HDR mode helped to some extent.  \n  \nUnfortunately, turning HDR mode on made image capturing and processing really\nslow, and this is one of our biggest complaints with the device. With HDR on,\nusers need to be steady for a few seconds to get a good shot, or else photos\ncome out looking awful.  \n  \nThe rear camera has a tendency to capture a lot of noise when there is no\ndirect light source. Some camera sample shots taken in the dark were very\npoorly defined and had too much motion blur. At night, the Redmi 4 managed to\ntake good photos only when we were close to the subject under a light source\nsuch as a streetlamp.The Redmi 4's camera app is minimalistic and easy to use,\nwith controls for various settings and features occupying only a small part of\nthe screen. HDR mode is just a tap away, as are the live filters. The phone\ncan record video at 720p and 1080p, and the videos came out decent overall.  \n  \nSelfies on the Redmi 4 can be an issue if you want a candid one, again because\nimage processing is slow. We ended up with a slew of blurred selfies just\nbecause we wanted to take one quickly. Other than this issue, our sample\nphotos taken in good light had a good amount of detail and decent colour tone.\nIn low light, we had a tough time, and faces came out looking too grainy.  \n  \nOverall, the Xiaomi Redmi 4's cameras are definitely an improvement over those\nof the Redmi 3S Prime (Review), in terms of focusing and results. There are\nfew issues like poor low-light shots and slow processing in HDR mode, which we\nhope can be fixed - or at least improved upon - with updates.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 performance  \nGeneral performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is decent, and the device handled\nmost tasks well. The MIUI interface at times felt sluggish, but this doesn't\naffect performance within apps such as when playing games such as Asphalt 8\nand Cut the Rope 2. We had no major concerns during the entire review period.\nThere was also no noticeable overheating.  \n  \nOur unit had 3GB of RAM, and there was roughly 1.2GB free at any given time,\nwhich means those on the 2GB RAM variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 might struggle\nwith multi-tasking on their units. Despite roughly 1GB of free memory on our\nunit, we didn't have to deal with any crashes or slowdowns, but we would\nrecommend opting for the variant with 4GB of RAM if you can spend a little\nmore.  \n  \nVoice call quality was decent, and the phone supports VoLTE. The phone doesn't\nship with a headset, so we checked the sound quality using our own earphones,\nand were quite impressed. You get several options to tweak music with the Mi\nSound Enhancer feature when using earphones. The Redmi 4 was also able to play\nour assortment of test videos with ease.The 5-inch IPS display is bright and\ntext appears sharp. The screen is crisp with decent viewing angles. However,\nthis isn't the best HD display we've seen on a Redmi phone. Colour\nreproduction is decent, but in our opinion, the Redmi 3S was better. The\nscreen was readable and usable under direct sunlight. Movies and games look\ngood on the 5-inch display, though some might prefer a bigger screen. There's\na Reading mode on the device that reduces background glare. Users can manually\ncontrol colours and saturation on the device through the Settings app.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 scored 43,677 in AnTuTu and 22,996 in Quadrant. We also ran\n3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench, where the phone scored 5,890 points and\n25fps respectively. These scores are on par with those of other phones powered\nby the Snapdragon 430 processor.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 lasted for 14 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test,\nwhich is impressive. We can partly credit the battery loop test performance to\nthe low-impact HD screen resolution. With regular use, the battery lasted over\na day. There are also power saving modes to help squeeze more life out of each\ncharge. The phone doesn't come with a fast charging adapter but Xiaomi's Jai\nMani told us that it does support fast charging. We can expect Xiaomi to sell\na fast charging adapter for the Redmi 4 as an optional accessory, or you could\nbuy a third-party one.\n\n", "I've been using this phone from 5 weeks. Here's some pros and cons of the\ndevice  \nPros:  \n1\\. Design...because of aluminium body although it is not fully covered and\n2.5D curved glass is giving better grip to hold the phone  \n2\\.

As I was previously said camera is good...but it is struggling while\ntaking macro shots and auto focusing the object sometimes and there is no\noption of shutter speed in manual mode. Night pictures are not up to the\nmark.. lot of noise in the pictures. Front camera is okay.  \n2\\. It becomes warm when I keep using this from long time but okay with this.  \n3\\. I feel like data cable is short and it taking around 3hrs from 0 to 100%.  \n4.No news on nougat update.  \n5\\. Hybrid Sim slot... For me it's not a problem.  \n6\\. No gorilla glass..my phone was dropped off by 1 feet now it's having a\nsmall crack even though it was covered with temper glass.  \n7\\. Only back portion of the body is covered with aluminum...

You can also play most of the graphic-intensive games,\nalbeit with a few frame skips here and there or graphic settings turned down.\nOne of the impressive things is that even while gaming, the phone did not get\nhot.  \n  \nHardware  \n\\-----------------  \nThe dual SIM smartphone features a hybrid slot, so essentially, you can either\nuse two SIM cards or one SIM card and one microSD card. If you need to use two\nSIMs and are a content hog, maybe you\u2019d like to opt for the top variant that\noffers 64 GB internal storage. The Redmi 4 packs in an IR blaster that you can\nconfigure to use your phone as a remote control for several electronic\nappliances at your home. The fingerprint scanner located at the back is quite\ngood, and apart from authentication, can also be used to take photos,\nespecially those selfies.  \n  \nCamera  \n\\---------------  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 packs a 13MP rear camera with LED flash that can manage some\ngreat shots with good color reproduction and sharpness.  \n  \nXiaomi deserves credit for its impressive camera algorithms that makes the\nRedmi 4 a fast and dependable shooter. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera\nmanages decent selfies that are good enough for social sharing. There\u2019s\nnothing special there, although most would not expect that anyway.  \n  \nSpecifications  \n\\-----------------------  \nOperating System MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow  \nDisplay 5-inch HD(1280 x 720)  \n2.5D curved glass display  \n450nit brightness  \nProcessor 1.4GHz Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435  \nAdreno 505 GPU  \nRAM 2/3/4 GB  \nInternal Storage 16/32/64 GB  \nExpandable up to 128 GB with microSD card  \nRear Camera 13 MP with LED flash  \nf/2.0 aperture  \n5P lens  \nPhase-detection Auto-focus (PDAF)  \nFront Camera 5 MP  \nf/2.2 aperture  \nBattery 4,100 mAh  \nDimensions 139.24 x 69.96 x 8.65 mm  \nWeight 150 grams  \n  \nConclusion  \n\\-------------------  \nIt\u2019s a great package with solid chassis, Qualcomm\u2019s newer chipset, decent\ncamera, and great battery life. The only shortcoming of the device is lack of\nAndroid Nougat out of the box. If you\u2019re planning to pick up a budget\nsmartphone right now, it\u2019s hard to look further than Redmi 4. At this stage,\none can safely say that it\u2019s hard to go wrong with a Xiaomi.\n\n", "I think This is the Best phone under this price segment. First of all I want\nto say that its battery is just a beast and camera is much improved than the\n3s prime which I was using earlier .The Phone delivers a decent performance.\nLets us look at the Pros and the Cons about this phone.  \n  \nPros-  \n  \n1\\. The main highlight of the device is it\u2019s massive long lasting battery\nlife, Xiaomi Redmi 4 is powered by 4,100 mAh Battery which is really great in  \nthis price  \n2\\. The smartphone is powered by Snapdragon 435 Processor which ensure the\npowerful performance of the device.  \n3\\. The Redmi 4 is packed with a beautiful all-metal body with 5-inch HD\n(720\u00d71280 pixels) 2.5D curved glass display.  \n4\\. There is a fingerprint scanner in the phones which is quite appreciable in\nthis affordable price.  \n5\\. In device you will get multiple RAM choices which are 2GB/ 3GB/ 4GB of RAM  \n6\\. There is a 13 MP primary camera with PDAF and LED flash in Redmi 4 that\nyou will not find in any other phone with same price tag and with such  \nspecs configuration  \n7\\. Redmi 4 comes with expandable memory via microSD card (up to 128GB)  \n8\\. Redmi 4 comes with multiple connectivity options like 4G VoLTE, Micro-USB\nwith OTG  \n9\\. It have a fast battery charging technology Quick Charge which can charge\nthe device up to 83% in just 30 minutes.  \n10.Xiaomi Redmi 4 comes with an Accelerometer, Proximity Sensor, Gyroscope and\nCompass.  \n  \nCons  \n  \n1\\. First demerits of Redmi 4 is that the external memory card slot is not a\ndedicated one, means you can either memory card or 2nd SIM. there is no 2.\nexternal card slot to expand memory.  \n3\\. The smartphone look bit heavy, it carry a weight 150gram.  \n4\\. The device comes with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS however the google\ngoing to launche android Oreo but still Redmi 4 do not have nougat  \nupdate.  \n5\\. The Camera cannot record videos in 4K resolution\n\n", "Received the item on time. Hatsoff to amazon for the same...  \nNow let's talk about the product. The packaging was excellent. here are the\nhighlights  \n  \n1\\. Build and Design (9/10): Now this is something which we usually don't get\nin a budget phone. The build quality is amazing. The rear antennas (plastic\nthough) match seamlessly with the aluminium rear. Now be sure to get a case as\nthe phone's a bi slippery. Talking about the ergonomics, it's excellent. I\npersonally don't like phones with bigger screens and find myself more inclined\nto 5 inch category. To sum it all, the build is good and the handling is\nexcellent.  \n  \n2\\. Display (8/10): Now this is a mixed bag. Not to say that the display is\nbad but it's what u expect from a budget phone. It's vibrant, the sunlight\nlegibility is decent, the touch response is excellent and the 2.5D corning\ngorilla glass is also good and provides seamless touch experience but the main\nissue is the white balance and contrast. The while balance seems to be off\nsometimes. Although we do get an option to adjust that but it's not accurate.\nHowever, the the lower level of the brightness is excellent. U won't have any\nissues using the phone at night . So, apart from the white balance, everything\nis good.  \n  \n3\\. Processor and Storage (8/10): Now comes the important part. I won't\ncomment on the internal storage as it's a matter of choice and may differ from\nperson to person. However the the processor is excellent as far as u get the\n32gb model. SD 435 is not as efficient as SD 625 but since the phone has\n4000,ah battery, it's decent backup. There are no lags and the gaming\nperformance is decent. No lags whatsoever. Heating is kept under control and\nthe GPU handles everything thrown at it smoothly. Although the loading time\nmay be more as compared to SD625 or kirin processors from honor but still, SD\n435 has it's own excellence. My suggestion would be to go for the 32gb model\nbecause the 64gb will cost u 10k and for the same price u can get the note 4\nwith a better screen and better processor. And yes, go for min 3gb ram as miui\nconsumes a lot of resource and 2gb won't do a justice.  \n  \n4\\. Camera and Audio (8/10) : Let's talk about the camera first. The camera is\ndecent. Although it has a f2.0 aperture but the low light performance is just\naverage. Daylight shots are above average an macro shots are decent. The stock\ncamera app doesn't have ample manual controls. I however have found a fully\nworking port of the miui camera which has manual controls for focus, white\nbalance, ISO and exposure. It also has the slow motion option missing from the\nstock camera.  \nspeaking of the front camera, it's good and captures decent pics.  \nThe video recording is good and no heating issues observed yet.  \n  \nthe audio quality is decent . Both the loud speaker and the headphone quality\nis decent.  \nSo the multimedia quality in total is good. U won't regret ur decision .  \n  \nThe battery backup is decent and u can easily get 5-6hrs of screen on time\nwith moderate usage.  \nCall quality and finger print accuracy is excellent and haven't placed any\ncall drop issue yet. The only con might be the hybrid slot.  \nNow, miui is a mixed bag. Although the miui 9 update has improved performance\nand stability but the battery backup seems to be hampered. It has decreased a\nbit.  \n  \nTo sum it all, This is a very good option under 9K category and far better\nthan those vivos and oppos...\n\n", "The 4100mAh powerhouse is able to run up to 18 days on standby mode and up to\n2 days with heavy duty usage.

Though it's a budget smartphone by Xiaomi but o must say they\nhaven't compromised with the build quality.  \nThe all-metal back of the Redmi 4 is polished and makes this phone look more\npremium than its predecessor. However, it makes the phone slightly slippery\nhence the chances of this phone to fall from hands is slight more than its\npredecessor.  \nThis phone has a screen size of 5inch and it fits good in hand and is easily\nusable with one hand. The fingerprint sensor is easy to use and easily\nreachable even using with one hand. This phone has one Mi logo at the rear and\nthe volume keys are to the right and are easily accessible while using with\none hand. It's has one usb port and one 3.5mm audio jack like other Mi phones.  \nThe navigation buttons are right below the screen but they aren't backlit.  \nThe one thing that Redmi could have improved in this product was to make\ndedicated slots for sim and memory card, but , they are providing hybrid sim\ntray like it's predecessor. It is a volte (4g) enabled phone but it's not dual\nvolte (i.e. one cannot use two volte enabled sim cards simultaneously).  \nRedmi 4 has a 5-inch HD (720x1280) IPS display with 2.5D curved-edge glass.\nThere's a non-removable 4100mAh battery which is the same capacity as the\nRedmi 3S's battery, and is being promoted as one of this phone's highlights.\nThe phone is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked\nat 1.4GHz. There are three variants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and\n16GB of storage; one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of\nRAM with 64GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports expandable storage using a\nmicroSD card (up to 128GB).  \nIt has a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED flash.\nThere's also a 5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. Though it's not a\ncamera centric phone but with pretty much manual camera setting you can have a\ndecent quality photo. But I must say this time the company had done well with\ncamera when compared with it predecessor like 3s.  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy.  \nThe performance of this phone is decent. It was smooth with most of the apps\nand games but, with high end games like asphalt 8 it felt a little bit\nsluggish.  \nBut I personally liked the way it performed because for a budget smartphone it\nwas a pretty awesome experience.  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 scored 43,677 in AnTuTu and 22,996 in Quadrant.  \nRedmi 4 provides some additional features like dual apps , quick ball , second\nspace, inbuilt app lock , child lock and so on.  \nOverall my opinion about this product is  \nDesign : 8/10 ( it has a premium touch )  \nCamera :7/10 ( it has a pretty decent camera though it is not a camera centric\nphone but I believe they could have done something more. But we also must\nremember that this is a budget smartphone )  \nPerformance : 8/10 ( decent performance , minor lags while playing high end\ngames )  \nAudio : 7/10 ( good audio quality , I personally like the position of the\naudio speakers. It's at the bottom end. )  \nDisplay : 7/10 ( display is bigger and good )  \nBattery : 8/10 ( good battery backup )  \nValue for money : 9/10  \n  \nThis product is definitely a value for money. Apart from having some minor\ndrawbacks like hybrid sim tray and camera this phone is a beast in the budget\nsmartphone market and also we can't expect much in this price range.  \nDo like this review if you find it helpful.  \nHappy shopping.\n\n", "Why you should Buy Xiaomi Redmi 4 (Pros )  \n  \nThe main highlight of the device is it\u2019s massive long lasting battery life,\nXiaomi Redmi 4 is powered by 4,100 mAh Battery which is really great in this\nprice  \nThe smartphone is powered by Snapdragon 435 Processor which ensure the\npowerful performance of the device.  \nThe Redmi 4 is packed with a beautiful all-metal body with 5-inch HD (720\u00d71280\npixels) 2.5D curved glass display.  \nThere is a fingerprint scanner in the phones which is quite appreciable in\nthis affordable price.  \nThere is a 13 MP primary camera with PDAF and LED flash in Redmi 4 that you\nwill not find in any other phone with same price tag and with such specs\nconfiguration  \nRedmi 4 comes with expandable memory via microSD card (up to 128GB)  \nRedmi 4 comes with multiple connectivity options like 4G VoLTE, Micro-USB with\nOTG  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 comes with an Accelerometer, Proximity Sensor, Gyroscope and\nCompass.  \n  \nWhy you should not Buy Xiaomi Redmi 4 (Cons )  \n  \nFirst demerits of Redmi 4 is that the external memory card slot is not a\ndedicated one, means you can either memory card or 2nd SIM. there is no\nexternal card slot to expand memory.  \nThe smartphone look bit heavy, it carry a weight 150gram.  \nThe device comes with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS however the google going to\nlaunche android Oreo but still Redmi 4 do not have nougat update.  \nThe Camera cannot record videos in 4K resolution  \n  \nConclusion  \n  \nOverall performance of the Redmi 4 is quites good, In this price you can not\nexpect more than this.

My needs\nfrom a smartphone are pretty basic: youtube streaming, browsing chrome,\nreading pdfs, using google maps, booking online rail tickets, taking\noccasional snaps and making calls. What follows is a comparison between Redmi\n4 and Asus Zenfone 5 (T00J) 2014 model.  \n  \nFirst the pros compared to Zenfone 5:  \n(i) Vastly better battery backup  \nUPDATE: I charged to 93% 7 days ago. After 7 days of standby and 7 hours of\nscreen on time, it is still at 30%. That said usage has been very light, and I\nhave disabled mi bloatwares (without rooting) using 'adb tools' and 'uninstall\npackages' commands. Auto brightness was also set at lower than midpoint, to\nsave batteries.  \n  \n(ii) Much stronger Wi-Fi reception with minimal heating and battery drain\n(Zenfone 5 had serious heating issues when browsing on 3G and WiFi)  \n  \n(iii) Much faster and accurate GPS fix with no intermittent signal loss (My\nZenfone 5 has serious GPS issues, yet its GPS ate battery like crazy)  \nUPDATE: I can now very quickly book unreserved ticket through UTS app from my\nhome window, never getting 'low GPS' error.  \n  \n(iv) PDFs can be read without any stutter / lag, pdf zoom can be adjusted\nwithout any aliasing / lag. Credit goes to combination of Adreno 505 GPU and\nAdobe Reader app.  \n  \n(v) A wonderful selfie camera (expected with the gaining popularity of selfies\nin India)  \n  \n(vi) Louder speaker in a better position (still not loud enough by my\nstandards, however better than ZF5's feeble rear facing one)  \nEarpiece volume at max level is equal to ZF5 and adequate after Nougat update,\nit seemed to be low before.  \n  \n(vii) More compact form factor, hence much more pocketable.  \n  \nNow the cons:  \n  \n(i) Display is significantly dimmer even in max brightness. Color gamut is\nnoticeably smaller: dull orangish reds and much duller blues. Yellowish tint\nis visible even after changing display settings to cool (fixed in MIUI9+Nougat\nupdate). No gorilla glass protection, shattering of screen is guaranteed in\ncase of a waist level drop (as judged from online drop tests). This also means\nthat the great front camera will become scratchy and hazy quickly.  \nUPDATE: I have applied plastic screen protector from Mi Store. It is a\nmediocre product as it does not cover display fully. It is also an fingerprint\nand smudges magnet.  \n  \n(ii) Rear camera has yellowish white balance in daylight, and worse color than\nmy Zenfone 5. No improvement in dynamic range either. However, I must admit\nRedmi4's PDAF is much faster than ZF5's autofocus.  \n  \n(iii) Phone is difficult to grip due to rounded side edges (though its in\nfashion these days and look-wise goes well with 2.5D glass). Zenfone5 on the\nother hand has a nice matte plastic back cover and rectangular side edges\noffering much better grip. UPDATE: I have ordered tpu cover from parallel-\nuniverse for better grip.  \n  \n(iv) 3 capacitive touch buttons have very little active surface area, often\nresulting in missed taps; a serious design issue to be fixed.  \n  \n(v) App opening time left something to be desired, even with no multitasking\nand 800MB free memory. Same as ZF5, if not a bit slower. I have already turned\noff animation in developer mode to speed up things a bit.  \n  \n(vi) The auto brightness is defective. It jumps abruptly from high to low and\nvice versa with little change in ambient light. I think this might be a\nsoftware issue, but it is still not fixed in Nougat update.  \n  \n(vii) Auto rotate is buggy and slow in chrome / youtube app.\n\n", "Redmi phone is nice & the storage of this phone is 64 gb whice is good gb & I\nlove this phone very much this phone features are Redmi 4 focuses on the most\nimportant aspects of a great smartphone experience.

It has a non-removable back panel, which is made out of\ngood quality aluminium, while the head and chin use polycarbonate for\nuninterrupted antennae reception. One thing that really enhanced the design is\nits curved back with rounded corners. It gives a smooth and comfortable when\nheld. The 5-inch display size adds up to the one-handed usability, aided\nfurther by the 2.5D curved glass on the front. In a nutshell, the smartphone\nis solid, has no sharp edges, feels good and sits perfectly in hand.  \n  \nThe 4100mAh battery does make it a little bulky for its size but 150grams\nwon\u2019t bother most of the users. It is 8.7mm thick, which seems decent for a\nphone with such juicy battery.  \nNow about camera and the finger print sensor,  \nThe camera lens is placed on the top left corner and the fingerprint sensor is\nplaced at the centre. The button placement is perfect for single handed usage\nand it gives has a tactile feedback. Moreover, you can easily reach the volume\nrocker, power/lock key, and fingerprint sensor without any hassle.(you can\ntake selfies without touching on the screen or volume button just with a touch\non the finger print sensor, it's show how phone is so user friendly)  \n  \nDisplay looks bright and punchy  \nThe Redmi 4 comes with a 5-inch IPS LCD HD (720p) display and a pixel density\nof 294 ppi. It has a 2.5D curved glass on top, which is said to be protected\nby an unspecified display glass. The 5-inch display looks bright, crisp and\nproduces vivid colours.( it has one hand mode operation which helps to operate\nthe screen in a limited area and can operate the phone with a single hand,\nuseful expecially while travelling in a bus)  \n  \nThere is hardly any smartphone that has a display of this kind. The display is\nbright enough to handle harshest of the sunlight.  \n  \nGood camera performance for its price  \nIt comes with a 13MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED flash.\nIt has a 5MP front camera with f/2.2 aperture on the front.  \n  \nThe PDAF (Phase Detection Autofocus) results in speedy autofocus and the image\nprocessing is also snappy. I was actually amazed to see the time it takes to\nprocess the image without compromising the image quality. Day light photos\nlook well balanced, but you might find it struggling 1 out of 10 times when\nthere\u2019s a light source on the foreground. However, the camera UI allows you to\nadjust brightness using the scroller.  \n  \nMoving to low light images, the smartphone has got a huge improvement over\nRedmi 3s Prime. Knowing the fact that it is a budget phone, its unfair to\nexpect a lot in dim light conditions. If I compare it to other phones under\nthis budget, the low light images now look well lit, there\u2019s still some work\nneeded to be done for better details. You might end up clicking hazy or noisy\npictures if you don\u2019t have a proper light source.  \n  \nThe 5MP front camera is very impressive as long as there\u2019s some light. I was\nable to click some really impressive pictures under natural and well lit\nindoor lights. One thing that seems missing is the front screen flash, which\nwould have made it a complete camera in all the lighting conditions. The\nprocessing speed scales down in low light, resulting in grainy selfies.  \n  \nIt can record videos up to 1080p, which came out to be pretty decent in most\nof the scenarios.  \n  \nThe camera UI on the Redmi 4 is easy to use and offers multiple settings and\nmodes to play with it. One complaint that I have with the UI is its thick\nblack panel on the right side, eating up around 70% of screen space. On a\n5-inch display phone, it is always better not to clutter the viewfinder.  \nAnd about the battery and connectivity,  \nMicro USB port and loudspeaker grill  \nThe Redmi 4 packs a 4100mAh battery unit, which is one of the key highlights\nof this smartphone. Basic usage that involves browsing social media, texting,\nlistening to music or 3-4 hours of calling can easily get you more than 35\nhours of backup. For those who need a reason to love this phone, this is\nsomething you can\u2019t ignore even if you want to.  \n  \nAggressive users can get more than a full day of battery backup without a\nhitch. Xiaomi has confirmed the support for Qualcomm\u2019s Quick Charge 3.0, which\ncharges the Redmi 4 from 0-100 percent in 2.5 hours which is pretty pretty\nimpressive for a huge battery like this.  \n  \nThe new Redmi 4 supports 4G and VoLTE along with other connectivity options\nlike WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0 and microUSB. It is worth noting that it will allow\n4G calls and data only on the primary SIM, while the secondary SIM restricts\nto 2G calls only. Other than this, I did not find any connectivity issues\nwhile testing the device.  \n(Jio compatible with high speed 4G LTE network)  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 runs the Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz\ncouples with Adreno 505 GPU for improved graphic performance. Like all the\nXiaomi phones, this one also top of the line specifications under its its\nsegment. The performance will vary depending on which RAM variant is in use.  \n  \nThe 3GB RAM variant seems to be a perfect choice for basic to moderate users.\nIt can easily sail you through your social networking needs, moderate gaming\nand multimedia requirements. I tried playing some graphic greedy games like\nNova 3 and Asphalt 8, and realised that it stutters in handling some heavy\ngames but it can still handle some high-end games till an extent.  \n  \nApart from that, I was really impressed with the RAM management and\nmultitasking capabilities, as it didn\u2019t stutter much even after prolonged\nusage. It did not heat up while using it in an air-conditioned room but it may\nget a little warm when it\u2019s hot outside.  \n  \nConsidering the price that it comes for, the smartphone totally nails the\nperformance that you get on it.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the latest version of MIUI\n8 on top. If you look for something to complain about this smartphone, it\nwould certainly be its software. I am not a fan of customised UI personally\nbut if I get anything close to stock, works well for me.  \n  \nFor those who prefer customising their smartphones, MIUI may turn out to be a\ngreat software. It comes with a bunch of additional features, icon packs,\nthemes and bloatware apps. While some of the features seem to be useful, there\nare still some gimmicky features packed inside.  \n  \nThe MIUI eats up slightly more RAM as compared to the stock Android but it\nstill feels smooth and I did not spot any hiccup or lag in between animations\nand transitions initially.  \n  \nVerdict  \n  \nAt this price point, there is hardly any other option that offers the kind of\npackage Redmi 4 has. For those who find it uneasy using a 5.5-inch screen and\nwant a perfect alternate for a Redmi Note 4 or a Moto G5 Plus, the Redmi 4 can\nserve all your needs. The only issue with the Redmi devices is the supply,\nwhich Xiaomi says it's trying to improve.\n\n", "Was so interested with the performance of my first phone of REDMI and i bought\na second phone but opinion about this phone has completely changed due to the\nmanufacturing defect of the screen. The screen gets a small crack after using\neven without any physical damage or pressure application. The same issue was\nidentified in my friends phone also and he is also annoyed with the product.\nIf this is the case then i think customers will move to the consumer court for\nproviding a very wrong information that it is made of Gorilla glasses and it\nwould be a very durable product. so strongly recommend not to go with this\nproduct until this major manufacturing defect is sorted out and customers are\nnot cheated in the outset of buying this phone seeing the wonderful spec and\npricing.\n\n", "Thanks Amazon for delivering such a good product.

Since this is an older phone, the phone isn't bezel\nless like most upcoming smartphones like Infocus etc, but the size of the\nphone is nice and the in-hand feel is excellent. The front has a pleasing\ncurved glass.  \n  \nThe rear is all metal but is prone to smudging and fingerprints, but the\nfingerprint scanner placement is spot on. The Volume and Power Button layout\nis goos and the buttons are well built and offer good feedback. One thing\nworth mentioning is that the Redmi 4 is very slippery so beware of placing it\nin loose pants.  \n  \nDISPLAY  \nPhone packs a well readable bright display which has enough pixels to enjoy\nday-to day content. Brightness levels are good for using the device round the\nclock and we also have sweet MIUI Tweaks like a Reading Mode, Blue Light\nfilter etc. The only downside to this display is the inavailablity of Corning\nGorilla Glass and I noticed minor scuffs and scratches on the glass during my\nnormal usage of the Redmi Note 4 and I'm expecting the same to happen to this\ndisplay. A screen guard is a MUST.  \n  \nPERFORMANCE  \nThe Redmi 4 is available in a variety of specs and storage options and I opted\nfor the entry level variant at Rs. 7000 as I think it's the most Value For\nMoney Offering.  \n. 2GB RAM  \n. 16GB Storage  \n. Octa Core CPU by Qualcomm  \n. MIUI 9.2.4 with Android Nougat 7.1.1  \n  \nPerformance of this phone during my brief usage was pretty good and a pleasant\ndelight. The phone was breezing through apps like Snapchat, Instagram,\nFacebook all with multitasking without no lagging or slowdowns. MIUI 9 seems\nvery well optimised for this device and the smooth performance will please\nmoderate users.  \n  \nIf you push the phone too hard and try to multitask, it will exhibit some\namount of heat which wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable!  \n  \nSOFTWARE Experiences  \nMy primary phone has been a Galaxy S7 running on TouchWIZ based on Nougat. The\nMIUI feels like a blend of various mobile OSs and most apps draw inspiration\nfrom iOS and Stock Android. It's designed differently and may not please\neveryone. However, as a phone OS, it is very comprehensive and includes every\nbasic and advanced feature you'd need third party apps for. A list is included\nbelow. The gaming performance is pretty decent too and you will be able to\nenjoy intensive games in MODERATE Settings without Frame Drops and if you're\nadventurous, do try the HIGH QUALITY Graphics mode and you may be surprised\ntoo.  \n. Voice Recorder  \n. Screen Recorder  \n. Call Recorder  \n. Reading Mode  \n. Wireless Display Casting,  \n. Compass  \n. Scanner etc.  \n  \nBATTERY  \nThe battery is slow to charge using the stock charger and this is because of a\nLARGE Battery and lack of Quick Charging. The battery life is excellent and\nthe phone has an excellent standby time. Screen on time usage is about 5-7\nhours with mixed usage.  \n  \nCALL Qualtiy  \nThe call quality is good and network strength seemed better than my S7 on the\nIdea 4G Network.  \n  \nCAMERA  \nThe Camera is surprisingly good and outperforms it's direct rivals like the\nNokia 2. The Redmi takes photos quickly and HDR takes 1-3 seconds depending on\nthe lighting scene. I took most photos with the HDR off and the colour tones\nand photos come pretty good and they are definitely acceptable considering the\nprice point of the phone. daytime photos are nice and sharp and pack in a lot\nof punchy colour and detail. The video sample maxes out to 1080p at 30FPS and\nthe video comes out fine but do not expect it to do well during lot of shaky\nmotion as there is no OIS.The selfies come out to be very sharp and\nappreciable too. As the light reduces, the camera gets weak but this is the\ncase with any smartphone or camera in general.  \n  \nPROs  \n1\\. Good phone at a good price.  \n2\\. Good overall build with a nice and bright display.  \n3\\. Great specs and smooth performance for day to day users.  \n4\\. Hard to find a reliable budget phone than this one at the moment.  \n5\\. Good and long battery backup.  \n6\\. Feature Rich MIUI - But I tried making the Redmi 4 a Mini Pixel and\ninstalled the Nova Launcher and few other tweaks.  \n  \nCONs  \n1\\. Slippery Back with no Corning Gorilla Glass Protection making it a must to\nhave covers and Screen Guards.  \n2\\. Takes time to charge.  \n3\\. MIUI may or may not have fans.  \n4\\. Higher RAM variants not incredibly Value For Money.  \n  \nOverall, I really liked using this phone and it did not make me miss my\nprimary phone Galaxy S7, a lot.

I bought this phone on the first day of sale. Gotta admit Flash\nsales are such a pain ,I spent an entire hour to add this phone to my\ncart.Hopefully I got it delivered really quick. First of all, This is an\nexceptionally good looking smartphone ,kudos to its 2.5D curved glass at the\nfront and its smooth metal frame with tapered edges.  \n  \nNow without wasting your time ,I will share my honest opinion.  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfSHORT REVIEW\u25cf\u25cf  \n#Pros  \n-Perfect as a daily driver  \n-Call quality is premium  \n-No heating ,but gets slightly warm  \n-UI is user friendly and transitions are smooth  \n-MIUI is very customisable  \n-Build quality is amazing  \n-Supports JIO VOLTE  \n-Great battery backup  \n-Clear and accurate enough display with good viewing angles.  \n-Super fast and very accurate fingerprint scanner.  \n-Good pair of cameras for the price. PDAF works flawlessly  \n  \n#Cons:  \n-Still on Android 6.0 ,didn't receive any updates till now.Although Xiaomi has promised Android 7.  \n-I didn't receive a sim ejector tool despite being mentioned that it is included in the box contents.  \n-After sales service can be little tricky.(In my case the nearest service center is 80KM away)  \n-No gorilla glass protection(I know it's too much to ask for this price tag, But at least the 10k version should have had it)  \n-Battery takes time to charge because of its mammoth 41000mAh battery. Although ,faster than I expected it to be.  \n-Hybrid sim slot can be a con for some people.As you can't use Two sim cards and 1 memory card at the same time.  \n  \n#FULL REVIEW  \nRedmi 4 is made as an entry level smartphone or maybe an upper entry level\nsmartphone. So you should not expect its camera ,display and overall\nexperience to be like a flagship.I also own another Xiaomi phone ,the Xiaomi\nMi5 which is one of its flagships. I even compared some functions of Mi5 with\nredmi 4 and the results were quite Interesting.  \n  \nSo lets get started...........  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfFIRST IMPRESSION\u25cf\u25cf:  \nIt's a gorgeous looking smartphone with amazing good build quality for its\ncheap price tag.The design is very ergonomic making your overall in hand feel\nvery premium. Yes it is quite slippery but not so much like my Mi5. Anyway I\nwill definitely recommend a hard case with good amount of grip.  \nOverall it's nowhere near to cheap ,as the price suggest.Some youtubers have\nmentioned that it comes with corning gorilla glass, but it doesn't.It's\nactually one toughened glass.  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfPERFORMANCE\u25cf\u25cf :  \nAs said ,I also own the 2GB RAM & 16GB ROM version ,and even with that it is\ncompletely lag free and works just fine. The chipset inside is snapdragon 435\nwhich has an octa core processor and is also seen in Honor 6C ,Oppo A57 and\nredmi 4X. It is one of the latest chipsets from Qualcomm and comes with good\namount of improvements when compared with snapdragon 430(seen in Nokia\n6).Although its an upper entry level chipset and isn't meant for heavy usage\nyou can still use it for slight gaming, Adreno 505 GPU will handle the rest.  \n  \nThe performance of 3GB version is very similar .Its just the multitasking\nwhich you will see an improvement at the cost of battery life.  \n  \nIn day to day performance I didn't notice any lag or so.Apps opened up really\nquick just like my Mi5 and offers decent amount of multitasking. I am\nsurprised to see ,even with 2GB ram it keeps 3-5 apps in the RAM.The 3GB\nversion keeps 5-7 apps (not games).Although there are phones with better specs\nout there, I have found that this phone was able to keep up with just about\neverything I wanted to do, whether it is browse Internet, facebook,whatsapp,\nyoutube or anything. Everyday use has been great.So if you are buying this for\nsomeone who needs a smartphone for basic day to usage then don't look any\nfurther.Just buy it.  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfGAMING\u25cf\u25cf  \nI tested this with Asphalt 8,Modern combat, temple run ,and COC . Everything\nworks just good except with Asphalt 8 and MC ,there is noticeable amount of\nframe drops and the gameplay isn't that smooth. Well even flagships sometimes\nstruggle to run these heavy games ,So I am not at all disappointed.Other than\nthat ,COC and temple run works flawlessly. And the gaming experience is very\nsmooth.  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfMIUI\u25cf\u25cf  \nActually I don't like MIUI,generally . Because of its heavy nature ,even my\nMi5 sometimes shows some lagginess.Also the updates aren't as quick as you may\nthink. So I switched to LineageOS. But with Redmi 4,I still didn't encounter\nany bug or lagginess. Well time will only tell, let's see how far it will\ngo.Other than that, the MIUI is very customisable ,themes can change your\nentire UI. Also as everyone says ,UI is very close to IOS and it's actually\ntrue.  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfCAMERA\u25cf\u25cf  \noh boy ,for 7k version, this is by far the best camera,PERIOD. I have used\ntons of smartphones in the past ,and I have to say ,this one really impressed\nme. Although don't expect its as good as the Mi5 ,because that's a complete\ndifferent story. The f/2.2 aperture, PDAF and 13MP back camera takes some\nreally good pics in outdoor lighting conditions. There is significant amount\nof post processing going on in the background making your pics look much vivid\n,smooth and with nice bokeh effect.In indoors ,its ok. Nothing much\ninteresting ,although far better than the competition.The 3GB or 9k version\ncamera is same.Selfies are bright and very usable for social platforms.  \n  \nPlease checkout the pics I have attached below. I have also uploaded some\ncamera samples in my Instagram account (@AbrahamAbruz).  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfSOUND & CALL QUALITY\u25cf\u25cf  \nCalls come in clear and do not sound muffled.Its very similar to my Mi5 which\nis amazing in terms of call quality.The speakers are at the bottom like the\niPhone's and it isn't that loud but loud enough to hear incoming calls.Doesn't\nget muffled when you keep it on flat surface.  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfBATTERY\u25cf\u25cf  \nAs of now ,Its been 1 day and 1 hours since the last full charge and there is\nstill 66% remaining.Screen was ON for 3 hours. I didn't use it like I did on\nthe first day where I played all sorts of games just to test its performance\nand battery life. That day I got 5 hours of screen ON time and lasted 11 hours\non a full charge.Which is just amazing.  \nIn my experience the battery life of 7K 2gb version is slightly better .but\nnot by a huge margin. Despite having 100 extra mah ,the 1 gb extra ram seems\nto consume a lot of battery.  \n  \nWhat else should I mention....thinking.. thinking....  \nFingerprint: It is very fast and accurate. Just like my mi5.  \n  \nOh yes! the big question.  \n  \n\u25cf\u25cfIS IT WORTH FOR THE ASKING PRICE?  \nIn short, the 7k version is currently the best smartphone in this price range.\nMark my word ,you can't get anything better for this price. At Least as of 30\nmay 17. For a smartphone in this price range, you can\u2019t go wrong.It is quite\nenough for everything you need ,big battery ,good camera, above average\nperformance.What more do you want for 7K?. The 9k version is also good if you\nwant slightly better performance and more storage at the cost of its battery\nlife.  \nBut I know there are people just like me who don't have trust on Xiaomi's\nafter sales service. In my place the service center is very far ,also its very\nbusy all the time , there are big queues every time. I remember ,I had to wait\nfor 1 whole day for my smartphone to get repaired.So that's my honest\nexperience and you should be aware of that before buying a Xiaomi\nsmartphone.Other than that I didn't notice anything bad to be mentioned.Just\ngo for it.  \n  \nNOTE: Neither Xiaomi nor Amazon (or anyone else)paid me to write this review.\nThis is my honest and completely unbiased opinion.Not everyone needs money to\ndo a favour. Till now I have shared 450+ reviews on amazon to help customers.  \n  \nThanks for reading my review. I hope my honest opinion didn't hurt the\nsentiments of Xiaomi fans.I also hope that my review proved helpful for all\nusers ,who are in search of a smartphone in this price range.For any further\ninfo ,feel free to contact me directly or comment down below.  \nFinally, please spend a sec to leave a thumbs up below if you genuinely found\nit helpful.  \n  \nRegards  \nAbraham\n\n", "With Xiaomi Redmi 4, Xiaomi continues its legacy of bringing great featured\nsmartphones at a highly affordable price tag for its user.

Have always been an avid fan of Xiaomi smartphones\nand other products. Xiaomi products have never disappointed me. Redmi 4 is\nalready a long player in the budget smartphone market loaded with competitive\nfeatures and a nice battery. The phone looks good too (doesn't look like a\nbudget smartphone if not informed). What is more interesting is that me and my\nbrother in law have earlier used redmi note 3 together. And now we have four\nredmi 4 smartphones in our family. My mom, my wife, my brother in law and now\nme, each of us are having one redmi 4 as our secondary backup phone.  \n  \nLet me tell you this makes an awesome secondary backup smartphone along with\nyour primary one. The jet black colour suits my taste and gives it a more\npremium look.  \n  \nI am also amazed to find Xiaomi has given us a smartphone with all metal\nanodised aluminium body and a massive battery capacity of 4100 mAh at this\nprice.  \n  \nThe phone runs smooth and lag free even with a mere 2GB of RAM. I think most\nof the credit for this should go to the better performing SD 435 octa-core\nprocessor. The display size of 5\" made it a perfect smartphone to hold\ncomfortably on my palm unlike the larger devices (5.5\"-6\") that tends to slip\nout of your hands often. The fingerprint sensor works fast enough.  \n  \nThe only con I have found till now not only about this smartphone but all\nXiaomi smartphones are the idea of a 'hybrid sim slot' that compels you to\neither run for increasing more space (which you'll do anyway considering this\nhas got a mere 16GB of internal memory) or use a secondary sim, but not\ntogether.  \nAnother con is the camera. I won't say the camera is bad but it is decent,\ngiven the price point. Moreover, I have always felt the photographers should\nrun after a professional camera if they want a perfect camera and should never\nlook for a pro level camera in a smartphone. Smartphones are smartphones, not\nDSLRs.  \n  \nTo sum up, Redmi 4 makes an awesome budget smartphone and deserves to give\nSamsung a run for their money in the low-end budget smartphone segment because\nanyway, Samsung smartphones are pathetic in performance in this segment. And\nof course, it is a perfect gift to have! Thank you Wifey!\n\n", "I GET THIS MOBILE ON DATE 11/08/17.AND SINCE I HAVE UNBOXED IT ,THE MOBILE IS\nNOT EVEN SWITCHED ON AND ON CHARGING IT IS HEATING UP.

Here are some pros and cons of the\ndevice  \nPros:  \n1\\. Design...because of aluminum body although it is not fully covered and\n2.5D curved glass is giving better grip to hold the phone  \n2\\. Battery...4100mAh best in its price range...although I'm using full day\nI'm left with 20% battery.  \n3\\. No lagging...I'm using 3gb version till now I didn't find any lagging in\nthe phone  \n4\\. Camera is good but need some improvements  \n5\\. MI UI is good but I personally prefer stock Android. It also gives an\noption to clear trash memory.  \n6\\. Around 1.7gb free ram is available when I have unlocked the device and\nrecently I got MI UI 8.2 update after which I got around 1.8gb of fresh ram.  \n7\\. Voice quality and speakers are good  \n8\\. Scored about 43000 in Antutu best in price.  \n9\\. IR sensor works fine.  \n10\\. Fingerprint sensor works well in most of the cases.  \nCons:  \n1\\. As I was previously said the camera is good...but it is struggling while\ntaking macro shots and auto focusing the object sometimes and there is no\noption of shutter speed in manual mode. Night pictures are not up to the\nmark... lot of noise in the pictures. The front camera is okay.  \n2\\. It becomes warm when I keep using this from a long time but okay with\nthis.  \n3\\. I feel like data cable is short and it taking around 3hrs from 0 to 100%.  \n4.No news on nougat update.  \n5\\. Hybrid Sim slot... For me, it's not a problem.  \n6\\. No gorilla glass..my phone was dropped off by 1 feet now it's having a\nsmall crack even though it was covered with temper glass.  \n7\\. The only back portion of the body is covered with aluminum... Rest is\nplastic  \n  \nIf your budget is below 10k or you are the type of person who doesn't use the\ncamera professionally then this is the best phone. Best phone for a normal\nuser.  \n  \nHope this will help.\n\n", "It's been half a day since I have received this phone from Amazon. The phone\nhas been in this state from last two hours. Reboot on its own and still the\nsame state. Both, Amazon and the seller shall face the consequences for\ndelivering such a faulty product and not adhering to the standards. Never\nswitch to brands for trials. U will definitely end up with a load of\ndisappointments. \"Slow claps\" for breaking the trust\n\n", "I have had used Redmi 4A before ordering the same model, just scrapping the\n\u2018A\u2019, and honestly, I do not find anything premium for the increased price tag,\nexcept for sporting a metallic body and adding a fingerprint sensor. I got the\n4GB variant with 64GB internal memory which looks exactly the same across\nvariants.  \n  \nI will be placing the Positives and Negatives of this product in points. If\nyou are in a hurry, just go through the highlights; whereas those who needs\nin-depth analysis can read the description as well.  \n  \n::::::::::::::::::: Positives :::::::::::::::::::  \n  \n1\\. Lightweight --- The product is quite lightweight and it is easy on hands\nwhich does not feel being troublesome throughout the day.  \n  \n2\\. Metallic Body --- Owning a smartphone without a metallic body seems to me\nas a child\u2019s toy. Therefore, sporting a metallic body definitely delights me.  \n  \n3\\. Fingerprint Sensor --- As day passes by, once a luxury seems to become a\nnecessity; starting from Televisions to ACs to Mobile Phone. Similarly, having\na fingerprint sensor in our beloved gadget is now a necessity and I am glad\nthat it has become a part of our life.  \n  \n4\\. Impeccable Design --- Redmi 4 boasts an artistic design with curved smooth\nedges along with dual cut through at the rear giving it a definite edge over\nany \u2018seemingly\u2019 rival products.  \n  \n5\\. Powerful Performance --- Mi Redmi phones are known for their powerful\nperformance and rightly so, this device too does not seem to disappoint.  \n  \n6\\. Near Perfect Screen Size ---- We are in such a generation where 4.5\u201d seems\ntoo small but 5.5\u201d seems too big. In this highly delusional demands, 5.0\u201d\nseems to be best choice without compromising the form factor.  \n  \n7\\. Perfect Touch Response --- The touch of this phone reacts perfectly and\nthere is no lags whatsoever. I am using it with the pre-attached non-\ntransparent screen protection and still worked without any complaint.  \n  \n8\\. Extremely Customisable MIUI --- I have been a Mi user since the inception\nof their phones in the Indian markets and believe me, this current version of\nMIUI is too good for a customisable user. You will be more interested in MIUI\nrelease than Android Updates. Don\u2019t believe me? Try it!  \n  \n9\\. Extraordinary Mi Apps --- Apart from the customisation, some of the apps\n(like Mi Remote, Scanner) works perfectly and might even be better than Google\nPlay Apps available. In addition, there are tons of Themes, Ringtones,\nWallpapers preloaded and also easily downloadable (via stock app) which many\nmight feel attracted to.  \n  \n10\\. Impressive Battery Backup --- Redmi 4 packs with a 4100 mAh battery which\ntake care if the power requirements and easily goes beyond the day in spite of\nheavy usage.  \n  \n11\\. Impressive Call Quality and Balanced Network Strength --- I have had\nchecked with numerous operators and found that Redmi phones has impressive\ncall quality with apt coverage. Even the likes of Moto, Lenovo has issues with\nsignal strength but not Redmis.  \nIt is to be however noted that I possess a Nokia E series phone which still\nbeats all the modern smartphones, including Redmi 4 in terms of network bars\nin congested area. Indeed, old Nokia is a trendsetter!  \n  \n::::::::::::::::::: Negatives :::::::::::::::::::  \n  \n1\\. Unimpressive Speaker Output Quality --- The Redmi 4 has mono speaker at\nthe bottom right side and I am quite disappointed at the output quality. Even\na Redmi 2 Prime, released 3 years back pitches much better quality output.  \n  \n2\\. Hybrid Slot --- Though it has become an industry standard, I personally\nhate this so-called feature which does not let users take the pleasure of both\nworlds. Even after such advancement, we have to choose between SIM Card or SD\nCard and this disappoints me.  \n  \n3\\. Non-Backlit Navigational Button --- The navigational button at the bottom\nare not backlit which tends to make me a little sad. Surely, this could have\nbeen added taking in consideration the price bracket.  \n  \nAs we can see that the positive sides of this product clearly stands tall\namong the little flaws, I would recommend the readers of this review to buy\nit. I have been using it for about a week and is impressed by its performance.  \n  \nPlease Note: On social media, you will be finding memes with allegations that\nRedmi phones are so hot that they can be used for ironing or it can be used as\nDiwali cracker due to its blasting nature, which is clearly a hoax. For past 3\nyears, I have using Xiaomi phones (Redmi 1S, Redmi 2, Redmi 2 Prime, Redmi\nNote 3, Redmi 4A) and it is nothing as being alleged by many.  \n  \nI will keep on editing as an when I found few points to add making the review\ninformative.

The Xiaomi Redmi 3S (and\nRedmi 3S Prime) launched in India in August last year, and the company claims\nthat they are the highest selling smartphones in the online segment, having\nsold four million units in just nine months. Despite this, the all-new Xiaomi\nRedmi 4 will soon replace the popular Redmi 3S (and Redmi 3S Prime).  \n  \nXiaomi has so far seen a string of successes with its Redmi range, with most\nmodels finding place in our periodic lists of the best budget phones. This new\nXiaomi Redmi 4 will not only have to take on the competition, but also live up\nto its predecessor in a lot of ways, and it certainly seems like an\nimprovement when it comes to specifications. Let's find out whether the phone\nis worth your time and money in our Xiaomi Redmi 4 review:Xiaomi Redmi 4\ndesign  \n  \nWhen the Redmi 4 arrived at our office for the first time, we mistook it for a\n'Lite' or smaller variant of the Redmi Note 4. You can see plenty of design\nsimilarities between the two. Jai Mani, Lead Product Manager at Xiaomi told\nGadgets 360 at a pre-launch briefing that the Redmi 4's looks are consciously\nmore in sync with the bigger Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review). The all-metal back\nof the Redmi 4 is polished and makes this phone look more premium than its\npredecessor. However, it makes the phone slightly slippery, and we nearly\ndropped it a couple of times while trying to take photos during the review\nperiod.  \n  \nThere has not been much change to the basic Redmi formula. Much like the Redmi\n3S, the Redmi 4 features a 5-inch screen. The new model, however, is slightly\nthicker at 8.65mm and heavier at 150 grams. The Redmi 3S measured 8.5mm and\nweighed at 144 grams. Overall the increase in thickness or weight doesn't\nchange much for the Redmi 4 as the phone is still quite usable with just one\nhand, and in fact fits better in the hand than the outgoing model.We had no\nproblem reaching the Redmi 4 fingerprint sensor at any time. The phone has\nonly one Mi logo on the rear, but there's also a \"Designed by Xiaomi /\nAssembled in India\" statement embossed in tiny letters. We like the attention\ndetail, such as a protective ring around the camera lens.  \n  \nThe power and volume buttons are on the right, and are easily accessible when\nusing the phone with just one hand. There is a Micro-USB port for charging and\ndata transfers on the bottom, with grilles on either side, though only one of\nthem is actually a speaker. The 3.5mm audio socket and an Infrared emitter can\nbe found on the top.  \n  \nRedmi 4's navigation buttons are placed right below the screen but they aren't\nbacklit, which means locating them in the dark is tough.The notification LED\nis right below the Home button and is bright enough to alert users about\nincoming notifications. Much like other Redmi smartphones, the new Redmi 4\nalso has a hybrid dual-SIM tray, which means that you will have to decide\nwhether to use two SIM cards or one SIM along with a microSD card. The Redmi 4\nwill be available in Champagne Gold and Matte Black, and we received the\nlatter for the review.  \n  \nYou get standard set of documents, a data cable, a power adaptor, and a SIM\nejector tool along with the phone itself in the retail box.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 specifications and software  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 features a 5-inch HD (720x1280) IPS display with 2.5D curved-\nedge glass. This seems to be the first time that Xiaomi is using 2.5D glass on\na Redmi smartphone priced below Rs. 10,000. There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery, and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. The phone is powered by an octa-\ncore Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. There are three\nvariants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; one with 3GB\nof RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. Our\nreview unit had 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports\nexpandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).  \n  \nYou get a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED\nflash. There's also a 5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. The new\nRedmi 4 will support 4G and VoLTE along with other connectivity options. When\ntwo SIM cards are used, only the primary one will allow 4G calls and data\nwhile the secondary SIM falls back to 2G calls only.  \n  \nSo was this review helpful to you please let me know\n\n", "HIGHLIGHTS  \n\u2022 Three variants of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 have been launched in India  \n\u2022 Overall performance of the device is decent  \n\u2022 Battery life  \n  \n@Xiaomi Redmi 4 specifications and software  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 features a 5-inch HD (720x1280) IPS display with 2.5D curved-\nedge glass.

There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery, and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. PROCESSOR  \nThe phone is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked\nat 1.4GHz. There are three variants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and\n16GB of storage; one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of\nRAM with 64GB of storage.  \nThe new Redmi 4 will support 4G and VoLTE along with other connectivity\noptions. When two SIM cards are used, only the primary one will allow 4G calls\nand data while the secondary SIM falls back to 2G calls only.  \n  \n@SOFTWARE  \nThe phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with Xiaomi's MIUI 8.2 skin. This\nis a stable build which is identical to what I saw on the Redmi Note 4 and\nRedmi 4A. This means that the Redmi 4 has a lot of software features that I\nhave already seen, including Dual Apps, which lets you create a second\ninstance of any app and supports Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and\nmore. The Quick Ball feature lets users assign shortcuts for features. One-\nhanded mode shrinks the display to one corner of the screen so that\neverything's easier to reach. The phone also gets a scrolling screenshot\nfeature that will let you take screenshot of an entire Web page. Child Mode\nlets users lock apps, and Second Space creates a separate profile to help\nusers manage business and personal data on the same device.  \n  \n@Xiaomi Redmi 4 design  \nThe all-metal back of the Redmi 4 is polished and makes this phone look more\npremium than its previous models . However, it makes the phone slightly\nslippery, and I nearly dropped it a couple of times while clicking photos.  \nMuch like the Redmi 3S, the Redmi 4 features a 5-inch screen. The new model,\nhowever, is slightly thicker at 8.65mm and heavier at 150 grams. The Redmi 3S\nmeasured 8.5mm and weighed at 144 grams. Overall the increase in thickness or\nweight doesn't change much for the Redmi 4 as the phone is still quite usable\nwith just one hand, and in fact fits better in the hand than the outgoing\nmodel.  \nI had no problem reaching the Redmi 4 fingerprint sensor at any time. The\npower and volume buttons are on the right, and are easily accessible when\nusing the phone with just one hand. There is a Micro-USB port for charging and\ndata transfers on the bottom, with grilles on either side, though only one of\nthem is actually a speaker. The 3.5mm audio socket and an Infrared emitter can\nbe found on the top.  \nRedmi 4's navigation buttons are placed right below the screen but they aren't\nbacklit, which means locating them in the dark is tough.The notification LED\nis right below the Home button and is bright enough to alert users about\nincoming notifications. Much like other Redmi smartphones, the new Redmi 4\nalso has a hybrid dual-SIM tray, which means that you will have to decide\nwhether to use two SIM cards or one SIM along with a microSD card. The Redmi 4\nwill be available in Champagne Gold and Matte Black  \nBox Contains are standard set of documents, a data cable, a power adaptor, and\na SIM ejector tool along with the phone itself.  \n  \n@Xiaomi Redmi 4 camera  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy. Compared to the Redmi 3S Prime, I found that\nautofocus on the Redmi 4 was a bit quicker. Camera samples were detailed and\nsharp, with colours that were vibrant and truly popped. Landscapes had\naccurate colours for the most part as well as reasonable detail. Macro or\nclose-up shots had a slight haze when seen full-size on a desktop monitor,\nthough the HDR mode helped to some extent. The phone can record video at 720p\nand 1080p, and the videos came out decent overall.  \nSelfies on the Redmi 4 can be an issue if you want a candid one, again because\nimage processing is slow. photos taken in good light had a good amount of\ndetail and decent colour tone. In low light, I had a tough time, and faces\ncame out looking too grainy.  \n  \n@Xiaomi Redmi 4 performance  \nGeneral performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is decent, and the device handled\nmost tasks well. performance within playing games such as Asphalt 8 and Cut\nthe Rope 2. I had no major concerns during the entire review period. There was\nalso no noticeable overheating.  \nMy phone is of 3GB RAM, and there was roughly 1.2GB free at any given time,\nwhich means those on the 2GB RAM variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 might struggle\nwith multi-tasking on their units. Despite roughly 1GB of free memory on our\nunit, I didn't have to deal with any crashes or slowdowns, but I would\nrecommend opting for the variant with 4GB of RAM if you can spend a little\nmore  \nVoice call quality was decent, and the phone supports VoLTE. The phone doesn't\nship with a headset, so I checked the sound quality using my our own\nearphones, and were quite impressed.  \n  \n@DISPLAY  \nThe 5-inch IPS display is bright and text appears sharp. The screen is crisp\nwith decent viewing angles. However, this isn't the best HD display I seen on\na Redmi phone. Colour reproduction is decent The screen was readable and\nusable under direct sunlight. Movies and games look good on the 5-inch\ndisplay, though some might prefer a bigger screen. There's a Reading mode on\nthe device that reduces background glare. Users can manually control colours\nand saturation on the device through the Settings app.  \n  \n@BATTERY  \nI Played HD videos on Redmi 4 & it lasted for 14 hours and 20 minutes ,which\nis impressive.With regular use, the battery lasted over a day. There are also\npower saving modes to help squeeze more life out of each charge. The phone\ndoesn't come with a fast charging adapter but it does support fast charging. I\ncan expect Xiaomi to sell a fast charging adapter for the Redmi 4 as an\noptional accessory, or you could buy a third-party one.  \n  \n@Verdict  \nIn the past, Xiaomi's Redmi models have set the standard for other phones in\nthe same price segment, and have also showed just how much a budget smartphone\ncan be capable of. The same holds true for the all-new Redmi 4. Xiaomi's\nlatest entry in the Redmi range manages to tick all the right boxes when it\ncomes to performance, battery life, and design. Camera quality is one aspect\nof performance that this phone lacks in, but then again I can't expect too\nmuch at these prices.\n\n", "A great Budget phone. I am writing this review after using this for about 6\nmonths.This review will help you to clear all your doubts about this phone. If\nmy review will help, then press yes.  \n  \nPROS :  \n* It has a perfect size to fit in ones hand. So no one can complain that the phone is too big or small. Moreover, Redmi has provided one hand use so that the screen becomes more small for comfortable use.  \n* Camera quality is good. The front camera and back camera both works really well. It is packed with vast features to try with.  \n* The fingerprint sensor is brilliant. It unlocks really fast. It is placed at a good position so that one can easily open his/her device rapidly.  \n* After so much of use, I didn't felt any heating problem in this device. If you know how to use a phone it can surely works great.  \n* The speed of processing is great. I wanted the 4 GB Ram but it was not available at the time when I bought this. However the 3 GB ram also works smoothly. I have no complaints regarding to its performance. This phone has never hanged and stopped my work.  \n  \nCONS :  \n  \n* I feel the sound quality or loudness of its speakers is not very good. As compared to other phones, it has a bit low quality of sound.  \n* When I used themes from the store, the battery started draining rapidly. It was not able to run a whole day compared to earlier when I used the default version.  \n* The back is really slippery. I suggest one must use a good back cover with this phone or else the screen may crack as there is high probability of dropping it.  \n* The screen is also not strong, thats what I feel. I am using a tempered glass to protect it. You may also do the same.  \n  \nSo that was all. This phone is a beast as compared to other phones at this\nprice considering to its performance. If my review was helpful to you, please\nvote my review by pressing yes.  \nThanks for reading.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n", "After using redmi 4 for few months I am looking to give its review..  \n  \nActually I bought 3Gb ram and 32 Gb internal memory variant of redmi 4 it\ncomes with two more variant one is 2gb and 16gb +4gb and 64 gb so i bought the\n1 one i.e 3gb and 32 gb it also comes with 2 colour options Gold and black and\ni chosed black one because it's my favourite.  \n  \n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  \nDelivery,buying,packaging,Amazon service:-  \n  \nFirst of all buying i had to wait 2 weeks for booking this phone as this is\nnot available simply we have to wait for its flash sale which comes on every\ntuesday 12 pm.  \n  \nSo after waiting i finally booked this phone.  \nNow comes to delivery,i got this phone within 5 - 6 days from booking so it\nwas quite fast and surprising for me because they delivered it to me before\nthe estimated date.

Why this is being happened. when\ni add the product to the cart, it should goes to cart but it shows a message\nagain add to cart untill deal is finished.\n\n", "not a good product, camera ok, but processor too slow. if you open gallery it\nalways shows gallery not responding\n\n", "hai, writing review after using the phone for 2 months around:  \nNOTE: After using one and half month of usage suddenly this phones battery\nbulged up. And i have to use the warranty to replace the battery.  \nBecause of that bulging my phones outer case is bent and i have to use it with\nthat improper fitting.  \nSince, outer case is not covered in warranty i cannot replace my outer panel\non warranty.  \n  \nI have received this phone on 24 of July 2017.  \nand iam using this phone since then.  \nPreviously i used lenovo a6000 plus of 2 gb ram and 16gb memory and i got to\nuse around 1.5 gb of ram and 12 gb of storage space.  \n  \nPros:  \n1\\. Redmi 4 looks like a premium phone  \n2\\. We can feel the weight and design is very good.  \n3\\. Display , touch are good  \n  \nCons:  \n1\\. out of 3gb ram you get to use only 1.5gb of ram which is not fair.  \n2\\. out of 32gb internal storage you get to use only 25gb which is not even\nfair.  \n3\\. Even if you install only 10 to 15 apps of around 10 to 30 mb each. The ram\nstill available is 1.5 only. I dislike it.  \n4\\. Heating: It is not acceptable. The phone heats. Yes that's true. When 2 or\nmore apps run phone starts to heat.  \n5\\. While talking the ear piece and the glass around the phone is also getting\nheated up.  \n6\\. I tried testing the phone by playing asphalt 8 and the controls are good\nbut the processor part is heating up initially.  \n7\\. After updating the phone and some bug fixes the heating is reduced a bit.  \n8\\. CPU-z software says that the temperature of my phone(no apps opened) is\nalways 39 degrees which is not good.  \n9\\. 2-day battery bkup(its false). My Redmi 4 battery lasts only for a\ncomplete day at normal use.  \n10\\. Finger print scanner is also not as fast as redmi 3s prime of Lenovo k\npower.  \n11\\. Camera clarity is not up to the mark. 13mp should be worth but it is not\nthe case with the Redmi 4. My friends iphone 5s captures good clarity pics\nthan Redmi 4.  \n  \nI wish i would get a better phone like my previous one or some thing like Red\nmi 3s prime at this cost.  \nAny ways i am using it because of no other option left with me, But i am not\ncompletely satisfied with the phone according to the memory wise, temperature\nwise and battery bkup wise.  \nI am satified with the looks and display of the phone.  \nThe strong ness is good.  \n  \nAnd the final decision is all yours friends.  \nI tried to disclose with you what ever i experienced with the product.\n\n", "Design and Display  \n  \nI\u2019ve used, liked, and called the Redmi Note 4 as a strong, well-built\nsmartphone for every reason it had. With terms of the design, the Redmi 4\nsimply looks like a shrunken version of the Redmi Note 4. The black one that\nI\u2019m using easily seems like a far more premium device than what it is priced\nat, with the design and build quality that it has. An aluminum frame on the\nback and that is flat until it reaches the sides where the convergence happens\nto give the phone a curvy and smooth finish on all the sides.  \nThe 5-inch display comes with the IPS panel and a 720p resolution keeps it\nsharp enough and the color output is great as well, or at least, so much\nbetter than the competition in the same price range. Great viewing angles and\nthe sunlight legibility is appreciable as well, which again is a good thing\nconsidering the fact that you are looking at a budget smartphone priced under\nRs. 10000.  \n  \nSoftware and Performance  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 runs MIUI 8.2 based on Android Marshmallow but the company\nis sending out a build with Android Nougat to developers and that indicates we\nwill see an update anytime soon on the device. The interface might be likable\nto some and others might not, but then if you are ready to get adjusted to it,\nyou will actually find a lot of useful features than the stock Android isn\u2019t\nable to provide.  \nOne of the advantages of this UI is that there is a lot of customization\npossible with the available settings.  \nI have used the 3GB RAM variant, which does an excellent job and while the two\nother variants have different RAM capacities and internal storage, the octa-\ncore chipset remains the same. All the basic chores, switching between the\napps, quickly launching the camera and taking a pic or anything that usually\nwould ask for some time to load, is flawlessly done here.  \n  \nCamera  \n  \nXiaomi has upped the game a bit, but note \u2013 just a bit, with the cameras.\nWhile the 13-megapixel rear camera of the Redmi 4 does capture great photos,\nit falters in low-light conditions and that is evident with the focusing\nissues and the noise in the captured photos.  \n  \nThe camera app has several modes including Beautify, Tilt-shift, Timer,\nStraighten, Scenes, Panorama, HHT, and the Manual mode where you can choose\nonly the White balance and ISO manually. The camera also supports burst\nshooting where pressing and holding the shutter button does the job. When you\nknow the MIUI interface itself offers the users with tons of things, the\ncamera app naturally will have quite a lot of settings to choose from. The\nscene mode has Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Night, Night Portrait, Beach,\nSnow, Sunset, Fireworks, Backlight, and Flowers.  \n  \nBattery Life  \n  \nThe little device among the giants these days should have had been an average\naffair when it comes to the battery life, but the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is a tough\nperformer with the 4100 mAh battery, which keeps me worry-free for more than a\nday on regular usage. I have used this phone as a secondary device but thanks\nto the nature of use, I would have the screen active for hours, and the Redmi\n4 easily gets about 5 hours of screen-on time with occasional data usage,\nactive most of the time on Wi-Fi, and the regular calling and usage included.  \n  \nIf you are going to use the phone as a primary one, or the only device in your\npocket, you can still be easily seeing it through the day. For the secondary\nphone seekers, the Redmi 4 should last for a couple of days if you are using\nit mainly for calling or occasional data or social browsing.  \nI hope you guys find my review helpful..\n\n", "Posting this review after 2+ weeks of usage.  \n  \nI wanted to give 4 star but ended up giving 5 star. Read below how did it\nhappen.  \n  \nThe reason behind rating 4 star was simple.  \n1\\. It did not come with earphone. As usually all mobile phones comes with\nearphone which is not the case here. It is a tricky part with this phone and I\nwas disappointed little.  \n2\\. It does not have separate SD card slot. instead it has two SIM slot - one\nof them can be used for either SIM or SD card. So you can not have 2 SIM with\nSD card  \n  \nSo, How did I ended up rating 5 then ?  \nAs I started using, It kept surprising me....  \n  \n1\\. First thing I liked about this phone is - Made in India. You will see this\nmark behind. It has a production center in Andhra Pradesh. So not 100%\nChinese. It does offer employment to our people and I am happy about it and\nalso encourage you to buy Indian products.  \n2\\. Smooth Edge 2.5d curved glass. This design was introduced by Apple. It\nfeels like a butter slice. No hard edges. See images. This is a complete\ndifferent experience from normal sharp edge glass phones. Finishing of glass\nis so smooth that you wont notice at all while holding. Really loved this\nfeature.  \n3\\. Finger touch ID. Its very fast as they mentioned. Before purchase I\nthought it would not be that comfortable as its on back and front thumb unlock\ncould be a great deal. But surprisingly this turned out to be a great use\nfeature. Its very comfortable at back plus I have locked many apps with finger\nID so while navigation I don't have to reach out my thumb to home button ( if\nit was there ) to unlock but as my back finger is already there to unlock and\nactually its a really fast way to operate.  \n4\\. Camera quality is good and very fast to click images  \n5\\. White and Gold color combination is awesome. iPhone style physical design.\nSee images.  \n6\\. It has MIUI, comes with many pre-built apps and features. Mainly focused\non usability and improve user's productivity. I really liked it. So many\nfeatures that you really need but wasn't there before. Now you can do with one\nclick only in this phone.  \n7\\. Comes with MI Cloud account, 5 GB free. I don't really use it. But its\nnice to have feature. Google already sync the data there so I don't want my\ndata on multiple place.  \n8\\. MI Remote - You can operate your TV, Setup Box, AC etc with this. Built in\nremote. It worked for my DishTV box. But did not work for TV submitted the bug\nand they may send fix.  \n9\\. No heating. I run very heavy apps in background. And while on JIO 4g it\nliterally burn out the phone previously. Now this phone I don't see heating\nproblem. It remains clam. Previously I noticed that I could feel good heating\nin my pocket with old phone and now I feel nothing. I tried every possible\nthing to heat up the phone, like on 4G turned hotspot and connected many\ndevice and started download etc. But no heating.  \n10\\. Powerful battery backup. With very high usage it lasts at least 1.5 day.\nThis is with 4G always on, few hours of hotspot, few hours of streaming and\n10-15 minutes of calls, downloading etc. Battery backup is really needed\nfeature. These days I usually see that people does not carry only mobile\nphones but they also carry huge heavy power back. Its really not ideal\nsolution. Phone is useless with battery backup and power bank is not solution.\nThis will reduce your weight of power bank.  \n  \nThere are many more small very useful features on software and hardware side.\nBut I just wanted to focus on above 10 main areas. Rest you can expect very\nstandard and better features than other phone which are available in market.  \n  \nNow as a conclusion. Close your eyes and buy it. It worth all your penny.  \n  \nSee Pictures for more details.  \n  \nIf you like review please click \"Yes\" to help me encourage write such review\nto help you make your decision.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 28 May 2017", "on 10 December 2017", "on 28 November 2017", "on 12 February 2018", "on 8 September 2017", "on 27 June 2017", "on 18 July 2017", "on 5 August 2017", "on 19 July 2017", "on 19 July 2017"], "reviewer": ["BHUPENDRA KUMBHKAR", "Keshav", "Gaurav Bhavsar", "Verified Reviewer", "Sujal Shrivastav", "SACHIN KUMAR SINGHAL", "KHADAROLI MASTHAN", "sanjay", "Vivekreview", "Pineapple Express"]},

This seems to be the first time that Xiaomi is using 2.5D glass on\na Redmi smartphone priced below Rs. 10,000. There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery, and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. The phone is powered by an octa-\ncore Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. There are three\nvariants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; one with 3GB\nof RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. Our\nreview unit had 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports\nexpandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).  \n  \nYou get a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED\nflash. There's also a 5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. The new\nRedmi 4 will support 4G and VoLTE along with other connectivity options. When\ntwo SIM cards are used, only the primary one will allow 4G calls and data\nwhile the secondary SIM falls back to 2G calls only.  \n  \nThe phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with Xiaomi's MIUI 8.2\nskin,including Dual Apps, which lets you create a second instance of any app\nand supports Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and more. The Quick Ball\nfeature lets users assign shortcuts for features. One-handed mode shrinks the\ndisplay to one corner of the screen so that everything's easier to reach. The\nphone also gets a scrolling screenshot feature that will let you take\nscreenshot of an entire Web page. Child Mode lets users lock apps, and Second\nSpace creates a separate profile.  \nThis version of MIUI looks cleaner and more polished than previous versions.  \nIt is really disappointing to see that the Redmi 4 does not run Android 7.0\nNougat, nor did it support Google Assistant.  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 camera  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy. Compared to the Redmi 3S Prime, we found that\nautofocus on the Redmi 4 was a bit quicker. Camera samples were detailed and\nsharp, with colours that were vibrant and truly popped. Landscapes had\naccurate colours for the most part as well as reasonable detail. Macro or\nclose-up shots had a slight haze when seen full-size on a desktop monitor,\nthough the HDR mode helped to some extent.  \n  \nUnfortunately, turning HDR mode on made image capturing and processing really\nslow, and this is one of our biggest complaints with the device. With HDR on,\nusers need to be steady for a few seconds to get a good shot, or else photos\ncome out looking awful.  \n  \nThe rear camera has a tendency to capture a lot of noise when there is no\ndirect light source. Some camera sample shots taken in the dark were very\npoorly defined and had too much motion blur.  \nSelfies on the Redmi 4 can be an issue if you want a candid one, again because\nimage processing is slow. We ended up with a slew of blurred selfies just\nbecause we wanted to take one quickly. Other than this issue, our sample\nphotos taken in good light had a good amount of detail and decent colour tone.\nIn low light, we had a tough time, and faces came out looking too grainy.  \n  \nOverall, the Xiaomi Redmi 4's cameras are definitely an improvement over those\nof the Redmi 3S Prime (my old phone), in terms of focusing and results. There\nare few issues like poor low-light shots and slow processing in HDR mode,\nwhich we hope can be fixed - or at least improved upon - with updates.  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \nPerformance  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \nGeneral performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is decent, and the device handled\nmost tasks well. The MIUI interface at times felt sluggish, but this doesn't\naffect performance within apps such as when playing games such as Asphalt 8\nand Cut the Rope 2. We had no major concerns during the entire review period.\nThere was also no noticeable overheating.  \n  \nOur unit had 3GB of RAM, and there was roughly 1.2GB free at any given time,\nwhich means those on the 2GB RAM variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 might struggle\nwith multi-tasking on their units. Despite roughly 1GB of free memory on our\nunit, we didn't have to deal with any crashes or slowdowns, but we would\nrecommend opting for the variant with 4GB of RAM if you can spend a little\nmore.  \n  \nVoice call quality was decent, and the phone supports VoLTE. The phone doesn't\nship with a headset, so we checked the sound quality using our own earphones,\nand were quite impressed. You get several options to tweak music with the Mi\nSound Enhancer feature when using earphones. The Redmi 4 was also able to play\nour assortment of test videos with ease.  \n  \nThe 5-inch IPS display is bright and text appears sharp. The screen is crisp\nwith decent viewing angles. However, this isn't the best HD display we've seen\non a Redmi phone. Colour reproduction is decent, but in our opinion, the Redmi\n3S was better. The screen was readable and usable under direct sunlight.\nMovies and games look good on the 5-inch display, though some might prefer a\nbigger screen. There's a Reading mode on the device that reduces background\nglare. Users can manually control colours and saturation on the device through\nthe Settings app.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 scored 43,677 in AnTuTu and 22,996 in Quadrant. We also ran\n3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench, where the phone scored 5,890 points and\n25fps respectively. These scores are on par with those of other phones powered\nby the Snapdragon 430 processor.  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \nOpinion:Should you go for it???  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \nIn the past, Xiaomi's Redmi models have set the standard for other phones in\nthe same price segment, and have also showed just how much a budget smartphone\ncan be capable of. The same holds true for the all-new Redmi 4. Xiaomi's\nlatest entry in the Redmi range manages to tick all the right boxes when it\ncomes to performance, battery life, and design. Camera quality is one aspect\nof performance that this phone lacks in, but then again we can't expect too\nmuch at these prices.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 will replace the Redmi 3S (and Redmi 3S Prime) over time,\nand will become the company's main offering in the sub-Rs. 10,000 space. It\nhas launched at Rs. 6,999 for 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; Rs. 8,999 for\n3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage; and Rs. 10,999 for 4GB RAM of and 64GB of\nstorage. Considering that the middle version, which we reviewed, had roughly\n1.2GB of memory free at any time, we would recommend that people to go for the\nslightly more expensive one if they can. The Redmi 4 goes up against the\nSamsung Galaxy J2 (2016), Lenovo K6 Power, and Oppo A37, but its biggest\nchallenger might be Xiaomi's own Redmi Note 4 which offers a better SoC, a\nbigger screen, and an improved set of cameras.  \n  \nThanks for reading the review.  \n[...]  \nTHANKYOU\n\n", "Sturdy looks good built quality and good processor sd435 when compared to\nother companies providing creepy mediatek in same price range.  \nI think in 32gb rom 3gb ram or atleast 64gb rom 4gb ram mi should provide sd\n625 as redmi 4 prime is not going to launch in India.  \nPros:  \n-Well build,sturdy looks that matte black aluminum back is love\ud83d\ude0d  \n-Battery Backup,the 4150mah battery is game changer providing 5-6hrs sot on 4G and YouTube play..  \n(But it would be better that xiaomi have provided sd625 as its based on 14 nm\ntechnology saving power)  \n-The charger provided is 5v 2A regular charger takes about 2.5 to charge fully, but phone support quick charge.  \n(buy auky or other quick charger Qualcomm tech. if you can risk on overheat\nwhile charging and reducing battery life span)  \n-notificatin led- their is single colured(light blue) led light, battery below 20% led blink blue not red (but atleast its provided)  \n-processor- the sd435 is decent processor can play asphalt 8, nova 3,nfs, fifa 17 on medium graphics setting with minimal frame drop( above 20mins of regular gaming on nova, nfs no limit 4g on.. made phone overhead 43-46 celsius) so regular highend gamers grab a phone with sd 650,653,810,820or835 based on your budget...  \nCamera- the back camera is decent performer 13 m.p f~2.2 aparteure gives good\nblurry effect and camera app is interactieve and provides fast snaps( see\npics)  \nCons:  \n-Biggest con is the poor memory management by miui the background apps are automatically closed\ud83d\ude22( yes i am a stock lover RIP cyanogenmod waiting for stable Lineage OS for Redmi 4x)  \n-The menu buttons are not backlit( you will become habitual after a while)  \n-720p display (can be a pro also battery efficient) though its not noticeable till you compare with 1080p display side by side.

The camera\nis 13 MP rear and 5 MP front. Image quality is good. There are multiple\noptions to tweak images. Images are fabulous with good lighting but don't hold\nup much in low light conditions. Same goes for video. If the light is good,\nthen there's no problem.  \nIf you wish for the best camera, Honor 6X is the best but it's a little over\n12k. I have no complaints so far.

The strategy has\npaid off spectacularly, as Xiaomi crossed the $1 billion revenue milestone in\nIndia last year. While the company's vast product portfolio now includes\nfitness bands, earphones, air purifiers, power banks, and other devices,\nsmartphones continue to be the stars, and the Redmi series - of which the\nRedmi Note 4 is the newest member - has been a key contributor to its success.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 follows in the footsteps of the Redmi Note 3 and Redmi\n3S, which were among the top selling devices online last year. The Redmi Note\n3, in particular, saw a lot of success in the Indian market with over 2.3\nmillion units sold within six months of launch. However, that model is almost\na year old now, and on Thursday Xiaomi finally launched the Redmi Note 4 in\nthe Indian market.  \n  \nMuch like its predecessor, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 model sports an-all metal\nbody and boasts of impressive specifications. While the Chinese version of the\nXiaomi Redmi Note 4 was unveiled in August last year with a MediaTek SoC, the\none launched in India packs a Qualcomm chip. The Redmi Note 4 has been priced\ncompetitively and will be going up against some of the most popular\nsmartphones in the market right now. Will the new Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 be able\nto continue the company's dream run in the Indian market, or will it turn out\nto be a run-of-the-mill device? Find out in our Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi Note 4 look and feel  \nThe Redmi Note 4 follows the Redmi Note 3 closely when it comes to design. The\nfront panel of the Redmi Note 4 is very similar to that of its predecessor,\nwith similar capacitive navigation buttons below the display and slim borders\naround it. There's also 2.5D curved-edge glass across the front, giving this\nphone a premium feel. The all-metal phone feels sturdy, and compared to the\nRedmi Note 3, the rear panel on the Redmi Note 4 is less slippery.  \n  \nThe rear of the Redmi Note 4 is a bit different though, featuring design\ncontours more reminiscent of the Xiaomi Mi 5 (Review). There are fine antenna\nbands running across the top and bottom. The rear camera, dual-tone LED flash\nand fingerprint scanner are set up much the same as on the Redmi Note 3. One\nof the few differences between the two is that this time around Xiaomi has\nshifted the speaker grilles from the rear to the bottom. The bottom also\nhouses a Micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, while the top packs a\n3.5mm audio jack and an infrared (IR) emitter. The power and volume buttons\nare placed on the right, and can easily be accessed with fingers.  \n  \nAt 8.3mm, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is slimmer than its predecessor, and just\none gram heavier. We had no problem using the handset with just one hand. The\nrounded edges of the Redmi Note 4 actually fit well in palm without causing\nany discomfort when used for long periods. When it comes to design, the Redmi\nNote 4 can be considered the best Redmi smartphone so far. It was launched in\nChina in Dark Grey, and Gold, though Grey seems to have been replaced with an\nexclusive Matte Black option in India. We received a Gold unit for our Xiaomi\nRedmi Note 4 review.  \n  \nThe 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display has a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels, which\nworks out to a density of 401ppi. Thanks to the full-HD resolution, text, and\nimages appear razor sharp. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 display offers punchy\ncolors and decent viewing angles, while sunlight legibility is also great. The\nscreen size makes the Redmi Note 4 well suited to watching videos and movies.\nYou can adjust the color temperature from the Settings app. A Reading Mode\nmakes the display more comfortable to use while reading.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi Note 4 specifications and features  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 launched in India is powered by the octa-core Qualcomm\nSnapdragon 625 (MSM8953) processor clocked at 2GHz with an integrated Adreno\n506 GPU. Xiaomi is selling three variants of this model in India: 2GB of RAM\nand 32GB of storage; 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage; and 4GB of RAM and 64GB of\nstorage. The company provided us with a sample of the top end variant for our\nXiaomi Redmi Note 4 review.  \n  \nThe handset has a hybrid SIM tray which supports one Nano-SIM and one Micro-\nSIM or a microSD card. Xiaomi notes that both SIM cards support 3G and 4G\nnetworks. The company has definitely taken note of complaints of the Redmi\nNote 3's 32GB microSD capacity limit. The Redmi Note 4 supports microSD cards\nof up to 128GB which should be sufficient for most people.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi Note 4 has a non-removable 4100mAh battery which is marginally\nbigger than the 4050mAh one seen on the Redmi Note 3. There's a 13-megapixel\nrear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF (phase detection autofocus), and a dual-\ntone LED flash. There is also a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.0\naperture and a fixed-focus lens. Users also get dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n,\nBluetooth 4.1, USB OTG, FM radio, GPS/ A-GPS, Miracast, GLONASS, and BeiDou.\nMuch like its predecessor, the Redmi Note 4 also gives NFC connectivity a\nmiss. 4G and VoLTE are supported, and we were happy with call quality.  \n  \nThe Redmi Note 4 runs MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Xiaomi has\nadded plenty of new features including Now on Tap which was one of the\nhighlights of Android Marshmallow, introduced in 2015. Google's Now on Tap can\nbe triggered within any app just by long-pressing the Home button and can use\nwhat's on screen as context for your searches. MIUI 8 on the Redmi Note 4\nlooks light and polished compared to previous versions. We were impressed with\nthe system animations, which look refreshing, including a neat one when you\nuninstall an app.  \n  \nMIUI 8 comes with a new Gallery app that automatically syncs stored photos on\nthe device with Mi Cloud. Users get 5GB of free cloud storage on signing up\nfor an account. The Gallery app now comes with video editing and sharing\nfeatures.  \n  \nThe Quick Ball feature, which was first seen on the Xiaomi Mi Max (Review), is\navailable on the Redmi Note 4 as well. This is a hovering button that stays on\nthe screen at all times, including on the lock screen, and lets users define\nup to five shortcuts for easy access.  \n  \nWith privacy in mind, the Redmi Note 4 offers Dual Apps and Second Space, two\nof our favorite software features. The Dual Apps feature, as the name\nsuggests, creates two instances of any app on the same smartphone, so you can,\nfor example, use two WhatsApp accounts at the same time. Second Space, on the\nother hand, lets users separate business and personal data on the same phone.\nThe feature lets users use two entirely separate Google accounts.  \n  \nAnother highlight of the software is scrolling screenshots, which lets users\ntake screenshots of entire Web pages. Xiaomi has also worked on its dialer app\nwhich is now light and easy to use. MIUI 8 brings a caller ID feature to the\nRedmi Note 4, which eliminates the need for third-party apps such as\nTruecaller. The Messages app has also received some much-needed tweaks in the\nlatest version, such as the ability to bundle similar messages into folders.\nIn our case, texts received from banks, food chains, and other services were\nmoved into one folder, which was helpful in prioritizing what to check first.\nThe preloaded Themes app offers plenty of options for wallpapers, ringtones,\nand icons.  \n  \nXiaomi has also included a one-handed mode, which basically shrinks the\ndisplay to one side of the screen and lets users select effective screen sizes\n- 3.5, 4, and 4.5 inches.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has plenty of preloaded apps including Security,\nCompass, Scanner, Recorder, Feedback, Mi Picks, Mi Community, Mi Remote,\nMusic, Mi Store, Weather, and a default browser. Unfortunately, there is no\nway to uninstall the preloaded Xiaomi apps. We feel that Xiaomi should reduce\nthe number of preloaded apps on its future devices or at least offer the\noption to uninstall some of them.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi Note 4 performance  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 was able to handle almost everything we threw at it,\nand we had no complaints with the octa-core processor. It handled heavy games\nwith ease and we had fun playing Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2 on the device.\nWe were able to use the Redmi Note 4 over the course of a few weeks and never\nfelt that we needed a more powerful processor. Multitasking on the Redmi Note\n4 was quick, and apps launched without delay. Our test unit with 4GB of RAM\nhad enough free memory at any given time. We noticed that 1.8GB of RAM was in\nuse at all times, leaving us skeptical about the experience we would have had\nusing the variant with only 2GB of RAM, which could be more popular due to its\nlower price.  \n  \nThe Redmi Note 4 is very good for media playback thanks to the excellent IPS\ndisplay, and it supports high-resolution video files, including 4K ones. The\nspeaker at the bottom is decently loud and we didn't notice any distortion at\nhigher volumes. Xiaomi didn't send us a headset with this unit, so we tested\naudio quality through our own headphones, and were happy enough.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi Note 4 managed an impressive 65,560 in AnTuTu and 42,690 in\nQuadrant, which is higher than what we got from the recently launched Lenovo\nP2 (Review) and Asus ZenFone 3 (Review) both featuring the same Snapdragon 625\nprocessor. GPU performance was also good, and we saw a healthy 28fps in the\nT-Rex test in GFXbench, and 9,029 points in 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme. These\nscores are along the lines of what we expected, but it is worth pointing out\nthat the Redmi Note 3 (Review) with a Snapdragon 650 processor achieved better\noverall scores.  \n  \nThere are plenty of modes to choose from in the camera app, including\nBeautify, Panorama, and Manual. In the Scenes mode, the device lets users\nchoose from loads of options including portrait, landscape, sports, night,\nnight portrait, beach, snow, sunset, fireworks, backlight, and flowers.You can\nalso apply filters while taking photos, which is nice. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4\ncamera app can record videos at full-HD (1080p) resolution and quality is\npretty good. Selfies taken with the Redmi Note 4 had good colors and details,\nbut again, those taken in well-lit situations were better than those taken in\nlow light.  \n  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 can take some decent\nlandscape shots in well-lit as well as low-light situations. Macro shots also\nappear good, with proper color accuracy and details. The PDAF feature lets the\ncamera focus on subjects quickly. Low-light shots have good detail, though on\nzooming in one can see the graininess. The Redmi Note 4 was also able to take\ngood photos of moving subjects.  \n  \nXiaomi has focused its efforts on improving camera quality on the Redmi Note 4\nafter complaints about camera quality on last year's model, and it's clear\nthat things are better. However, we'd still like to see low-light performance\nimproved.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi Note 4's 4100mAh non-removable battery lasted for 15 hours and 10\nminutes in our continuous video playback test, which is impressive for a\nbattery of this capacity. In real-world use, the phone was able to last for up\nto two days. With heavy usage, we got to nearly a day and a half without\nneeding to use any of the battery saving modes. We were especially impressed\nwith the handset's ability to latch on to weak cellular as well as Wi-Fi\nnetwork signals. We were not provided with a retail box with all accessories\nfor our review, and so we can't comment on how long it would take to charge\nwith the bundled charger. However, there is no support for quick charging,\nwhich would have been a welcome feature at this price level.  \n  \nVerdict  \nThe Redmi Note 4 is a great package with the only downsides being its hybrid\nSIM slot, lack of quick charging, and excess of preloaded apps. We think that\nthe Redmi Note 4 will provide tough competition to other smartphones in its\nprice segment, and even some priced a little higher. It scores very well in\nterms of design, battery life, and performance. For those who are looking for\na smartphone with a big screen and great battery performance on a budget, the\nRedmi Note 4 is easy to recommend.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has been launched in three variants in India. At a\nstarting price of Rs. 9,999 (2GB RAM + 32GB storage), the Redmi Note 4 is\ndefinitely a compelling option for users who are looking for a low-cost\ndevice. Our impressions are based on the highest-specced variant, and given\nthe difference in prices between the three, we would suggest people skip the\nlowest one if they can afford to. The version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of\nstorage has been priced just Rs. 1,000 higher at Rs. 10,999, while the version\nwith 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage - the one reviewed here - is also a\nreasonable step up at Rs. 12,999.\n\n", "The interface of the phone is such that the app icons are cluttered on the\nhome screen. One cannot hide the icons and these icons are not even in\nalphabetical order so I have to search the icon from all the screens. the\ncharging of the phone is too slow it would take about 8 hours to charge . and\nthe phone gives a backup of over 1 day with heavy use.  \nIf you can live with this pathetic interface then buy the phone... The phone\nis good otherwise\n\n", "I have bought this mobile on 20 June 2017 from seller Darshita Electronics At\nRs. 8999 ( Added purchase details at image)  \nSince there are no Detailed reviews on this mobile, i am writing a detailed\nreview.  \n  \n1\\.

The Xiaomi Redmi 3S (and\nRedmi 3S Prime) launched in India in August last year, and the company claims\nthat they are the highest selling smartphones in the online segment, having\nsold four million units in just nine months. Despite this, the all-new Xiaomi\nRedmi 4 will soon replace the popular Redmi 3S (and Redmi 3S Prime).  \n  \nXiaomi has so far seen a string of successes with its Redmi range, with most\nmodels finding a place in our periodic lists of the best budget phones. This\nnew Xiaomi Redmi 4 will not only have to take on the competition, but also\nlive up to its predecessor in a lot of ways, and it certainly seems like an\nimprovement when it comes to specifications. Let's find out whether the phone\nis worth your time and money in our Xiaomi Redmi 4 review:  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 design  \nWhen the Redmi 4 arrived at our office for the first time, we mistook it for a\n'Lite' or smaller variant of the Redmi Note 4. You can see plenty of design\nsimilarities between the two. Jai Mani, Lead Product Manager at Xiaomi told\nGadgets 360 at a pre-launch briefing that the Redmi 4's looks are consciously\nmore in sync with the bigger Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review). The all-metal back\nof the Redmi 4 is polished and makes this phone look more premium than its\npredecessor. However, it makes the phone slightly slippery, and we nearly\ndropped it a couple of times while trying to take photos during the review\nperiod.  \n  \nThere has not been much change to the basic Redmi formula. Much like the Redmi\n3S, the Redmi 4 features a 5-inch screen. The new model, however, is slightly\nthicker at 8.65mm and heavier at 150 grams. The Redmi 3S measured 8.5mm and\nweighed at 144 grams. Overall the increase in thickness or weight doesn't\nchange much for the Redmi 4 as the phone is still quite usable with just one\nhand, and in fact, fits better in the hand than the outgoing model.  \nWe had no problem reaching the Redmi 4 fingerprint sensor at any time. The\nphone has only one Mi logo on the rear, but there's also a \"Designed by Xiaomi\n/ Assembled in India\" statement embossed in tiny letters. We like the\nattention detail, such as a protective ring around the camera lens.  \n  \nThe power and volume buttons are on the right and are easily accessible when\nusing the phone with just one hand. There is a Micro-USB port for charging and\ndata transfers on the bottom, with grilles on either side, though only one of\nthem is actually a speaker. The 3.5mm audio socket and an Infrared emitter can\nbe found on the top.  \n  \nRedmi 4's navigation buttons are placed right below the screen but they aren't\nbacklit, which means locating them in the dark is tough.The notification LED\nis right below the Home button and is bright enough to alert users about\nincoming notifications. Much like other Redmi smartphones, the new Redmi 4\nalso has a hybrid dual-SIM tray, which means that you will have to decide\nwhether to use two SIM cards or one SIM along with a microSD card. The Redmi 4\nwill be available in Champagne Gold and Matte Black, and we received the\nlatter for the review.  \n  \nYou get a standard set of documents, a data cable, a power adaptor, and a SIM\nejector tool along with the phone itself in the retail box.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 specifications and software  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 features a 5-inch HD (720x1280) IPS display with 2.5D curved-\nedge glass. This seems to be the first time that Xiaomi is using 2.5D glass on\na Redmi smartphone priced below Rs. 10,000. There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. The phone is powered by an octa-\ncore Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. There are three\nvariants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; one with 3GB\nof RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. Our\nreview unit had 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports\nexpandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).  \n  \nYou get a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and a LED flash.\nThere's also a 5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. The new Redmi 4\nwill support 4G and VoLTE along with other connectivity options. When two SIM\ncards are used, only the primary one will allow 4G calls and data while the\nsecondary SIM falls back to 2G calls only.  \nThe phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with Xiaomi's MIUI 8.2 skin. This\nis a stable build which is identical to what we saw on the Redmi Note 4 and\nRedmi 4A. This means that the Redmi 4 has a lot of software features that we\nhave already seen, including Dual Apps, which lets you create a second\ninstance of any app and supports Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and\nmore. The Quick Ball feature lets users assign shortcuts for features. One-\nhanded mode shrinks the display to one corner of the screen so that\neverything's easier to reach. The phone also gets a scrolling screenshot\nfeature that will let you take a screenshot of an entire Web page. Child Mode\nlets users lock apps, and Second Space creates a separate profile to help\nusers manage the business and personal data on the same device.  \n  \nThis version of MIUI looks cleaner and more polished than previous versions.\nYou can read about the software in more detail in our reviews of the Xiaomi\nRedmi Note 4 and Xiaomi Redmi 4A.  \n  \nIn keeping with previous Redmi phones, the Redmi 4 also packs lots of\npreinstalled apps such as Music, Mi Picks, Mi Community, News, Security,\nNotes, Recorder, and Weather. The Themes app lets users select themes,\nwallpapers, ringtones, and fonts from a store. There's also a dedicated Mi\nStore app on the device through which users can buy Xiaomi products and\naccessories. We believe that the MIUI interface could become lighter with the\nremoval of some of this bloatware, but not all of them can be deleted and they\ntake up valuable storage space on the device. There are also some preinstalled\nthird-party apps including Amazon, PhonePe Wallet, Flipkart, Facebook, and\nSwiftKey.  \n  \nUsers will get up to 5GB of free Mi Cloud storage when they sign in with a Mi\naccount, which is additional to the 15GB of free cloud storage that's offered\nby Google with every Gmail sign-in.  \nWe were disappointed to see that the Redmi 4 does not run Android 7.0 Nougat,\nnor did it support Google Assistant at the time of review. On long-pressing,\nthe home button, the Now on Tap feature for context-based searches is\ntriggered. Xiaomi says that the Redmi 4 will receive an update to Nougat, and\nwe might get Google Assistant before that, but no timeline has been promised\nby the company.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 camera  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy. Compared to the Redmi 3S Prime, we found that\nautofocus on the Redmi 4 was a bit quicker. Camera samples were detailed and\nsharp, with colors that were vibrant and truly popped. Landscapes had accurate\ncolors for the most part as well as reasonable detail. Macro or close-up shots\nhad a slight haze when seen full-size on a desktop monitor, though the HDR\nmode helped to some extent.  \n  \nUnfortunately, turning HDR mode on made image capturing and processing really\nslow, and this is one of our biggest complaints with the device. With HDR on,\nusers need to be steady for a few seconds to get a good shot, or else photos\ncome out looking awful.  \n  \nThe rear camera has a tendency to capture a lot of noise when there is no\ndirect light source. Some camera sample shots taken in the dark were very\npoorly defined and had too much motion blur. At night, the Redmi 4 managed to\ntake good photos only when we were close to the subject under a light source\nsuch as a streetlamp.  \nThe Redmi 4's camera app is minimalistic and easy to use, with controls for\nvarious settings and features occupying only a small part of the screen. The\nHDR mode is just a tap away, as are the live filters. The phone can record\nvideo at 720p and 1080p, and the videos came out decent overall.  \n  \nSelfies on the Redmi 4 can be an issue if you want a candid one, again because\nimage processing is slow. We ended up with a slew of blurred selfies just\nbecause we wanted to take one quickly. Other than this issue, our sample\nphotos taken in good light had a good amount of detail and decent color tone.\nIn low light, we had a tough time, and faces came out looking too grainy.  \n  \nOverall, the Xiaomi Redmi 4's cameras are definitely an improvement over those\nof the Redmi 3S Prime (Review), in terms of focusing and results. There are\nfew issues like poor low-light shots and slow processing in HDR mode, which we\nhope can be fixed - or at least improved upon - with updates.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 performance  \nGeneral performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is decent, and the device handled\nmost tasks well. The MIUI interface at times felt sluggish, but this doesn't\naffect performance within apps such as when playing games such as Asphalt 8\nand Cut the Rope 2. We had no major concerns during the entire review period.\nThere was also no noticeable overheating.  \n  \nOur unit had 3GB of RAM, and there was roughly 1.2GB free at any given time,\nwhich means those on the 2GB RAM variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 might struggle\nwith multi-tasking on their units. Despite roughly 1GB of free memory on our\nunit, we didn't have to deal with any crashes or slowdowns, but we would\nrecommend opting for the variant with 4GB of RAM if you can spend a little\nmore.  \n  \nVoice call quality was decent, and the phone supports VoLTE. The phone doesn't\nship with a headset, so we checked the sound quality using our own earphones,\nand were quite impressed. You get several options to tweak music with the Mi\nSound Enhancer feature when using earphones. The Redmi 4 was also able to play\nour assortment of test videos with ease.  \nThe 5-inch IPS display is bright and text appears sharp. The screen is crisp\nwith decent viewing angles. However, this isn't the best HD display we've seen\non a Redmi phone. Colour reproduction is decent, but in our opinion, the Redmi\n3S was better. The screen was readable and usable under direct sunlight.\nMovies and games look good on the 5-inch display, though some might prefer a\nbigger screen. There's a Reading mode on the device that reduces background\nglare. Users can manually control colours and saturation on the device through\nthe Settings app.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 scored 43,677 in AnTuTu and 22,996 in Quadrant. We also ran\n3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench, where the phone scored 5,890 points and\n25fps respectively. These scores are on par with those of other phones powered\nby the Snapdragon 430 processor.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 lasted for 14 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test,\nwhich is impressive. We can partly credit the battery loop test performance to\nthe low-impact HD screen resolution. With regular use, the battery lasted over\na day. There are also power saving modes to help squeeze more life out of each\ncharge. The phone doesn't come with a fast charging adapter but Xiaomi's Jai\nMani told us that it does support fast charging. We can expect Xiaomi to sell\na fast charging adapter for the Redmi 4 as an optional accessory, or you could\nbuy a third-party one.  \n  \nVerdict  \nIn the past, Xiaomi's Redmi models have set the standard for other phones in\nthe same price segment, and have also shown just how much a budget smartphone\ncan be capable of. The same holds true for the all-new Redmi 4. Xiaomi's\nlatest entry in the Redmi range manages to tick all the right boxes when it\ncomes to performance, battery life, and design. Camera quality is one aspect\nof performance that this phone lacks in, but then again we can't expect too\nmuch at these prices.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 will replace the Redmi 3S (and Redmi 3S Prime) over time\nand will become the company's main offering in the sub-Rs. 10,000 space. It\nhas launched at Rs. 6,999 for 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; Rs. 8,999 for\n3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage; and Rs. 10,999 for 4GB RAM of and 64GB of\nstorage. Considering that the middle version, which we reviewed, had roughly\n1.2GB of memory free at any time, we would recommend that people to go for the\nslightly more expensive one if they can. The Redmi 4 goes up against the\nSamsung Galaxy J2 (2016), Lenovo K6 Power (Review), and Oppo A37, but its\nbiggest challenge might be Xiaomi's own Redmi Note 4 which offers a better\nSoC, a bigger screen, and an improved set of cameras.  \n  \nOne big factor that remains is the availability of these phones. Previous\nmodels including the Redmi 3S (Redmi 3S Prime), Redmi 4A and Redmi Note 4 have\nbeen very hard to find in stock despite being listed on Flipkart and the\ncompany's own Mi online store.\n\n", "The detailed review after 3 days of using redmi 4. The ratings below given\nbelow are according to the price of the smartphone :-  \n1) Display :- 8.5/10  \n  \nYes, smartphones are providing 5.5 inch screen and 1080p display in same price\nsegments but is you are a person habituated to use smartphone with one hand\nthen it is perfect for you and with 2.5 D glass it feel premium. But it\ndoesn't carry a corrning gorilla glass in it, thus adding a downside in it as\nmany smartphones in this price segment do provide that.  \n  \n2) Design :- 10/10  \n  \nDesign is way better than any smartphone in this price segment and design\nfeels premium for a price tag of 9000  \n  \n3) Battery :- 9/10  \n  \nThe battery will last you long enough for more than a day. Takes 1 hour to\ncharge to 40% and 2.5 hours on complete charge. But will heat during charging\nso using smartphone while charging is not recommended.

Coming to ram you will be getting close to 1.5gb of 3gb ram,\nwhich is mostly because of heavily customized miui 8.  \n  \n6) Camera :- 8/10  \n  \nThere are many smartphones with on paper 13/5 camera in this price segment and\ntalking about the price segment of 10000 there are many smartphones with a\nmuch better camera quality.  \n  \nPerformance :- 8.5/10  \n  \nYou cannot ask for a very great performance at this price segment but you will\nnot face lags or frame drop in playing games like dead trigger 2 or need for\nspeed no limits but you will surely face heating problem on gaming and\ncharging.  \n  \nWell it is surely the the best phone under 9000 if you are looking for good\nbattery and small screen and is surely better than yu yureka balck in terms of\nbattery and camera performance.  \nThus making it the best option under 9k segment\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 3 September 2017", "on 12 July 2017", "on 23 July 2017", "on 1 June 2017", "on 25 August 2017", "on 2 August 2017", "on 17 August 2017", "on 3 July 2017", "on 20 June 2017", "on 21 June 2017"], "reviewer": ["subh", "Shivanshu Kumar", "Dadi Maa & Sons", "Amazon Customer", "Sanskar Agrawal \u2611", "Samarth", "Sunder Shukla", "shahid", "Sanskar Agrawal \u2611", "Amazon Customer"]},

Love our flagships as we might, not everyone needs the latest\nhardware or has money to burn, and that's where the Redmi 4 comes in.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 review  \nYou get a bright display, which despite the otherwise average contrast is\nquite usable in the sun. You'd also appreciate the solid battery life - the 4\nmay not be the battery champ that the 3 was, but it'll be there for you on the\nlongest of days. We just wish charging were faster.  \n  \nSome may find MIUI too colorful, but Xiaomi's Android overlay is feature-\npacked and will save you a few trips to the Play Store for everyday tools.\nThere's plenty of room for customization too, and the privacy features are\ntop-notch. Oh, and you do get a fingerprint scanner, which some of the big-\nname brands cheap out on for their entry-level models.  \n  \nThe camera output won't necessarily win blind shootouts, but photos are sharp\nenough, and the FullHD videos are among the better ones we've seen, on a\nshoestring or otherwise. The selfies are decent too.  \n  \nThe thing is, it's hard to find competition for the Redmi 4, not at this\nprice. In fact, if you're eyeing the Redmi 4, it may be Xiaomi's own lineup\nthat you need to look at for alternatives. There's the Redmi 4 Prime with a\nFullHD display and a more powerful Snapdragon 625 chip. Going for the Redmi\n4a, you'd save a few bucks, but concede a gig of RAM and 4 CPU cores resulting\nin a tangible dip in performance. Also, no fingerprint reader on the 4a. Or,\nyou can go bigger and opt for a Redmi Note 4 - larger and higher-res display,\nmore powerful chipset, even better battery life.\n\n", "Multipurpose Phone!!  \nEverything is perfect.  \n  \nDesign :-With a unibody metal construction, the Redmi 4 follows the design\nlanguage of Redmi Note 4. There are curved edges with a curved 2.5D glass on\nthe front which aids the ergonomics. The highlight of the design is of course\nthe compact form factor owing to the 5-inch display. It fits quite well in\none\u2019s palms and single-handed usage is a breeze.  \n  \nThe build quality is excellent and it feels solid, and the matte black variant\nlooks great and gives a very premium feel.  \n  \nHowever, the three capacitive buttons behind the display are not backlit. It\nis disorienting at first, but you impulsively know where your thumb needs to\ngo after a few days of usage.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 might be a budget phone but there\u2019s no compromise on the\naesthetics. In fact, with this outing \u2013 like before \u2013 the company sets the\nstandards for what affordable smartphones should look and feel like in 2017.  \nDisplay :-The Redmi 4 sports a 5-inch HD display with a 1280 x 720 resolution.\nThere\u2019s a 2.5D curved glass, similar to the Redmi Note 4. It\u2019s toughened\nglass, although there\u2019s no Gorilla Glass protection  \nThe HD display nevertheless looks fantastic in terms of color reproduction and\nviewing angles. The images and text looks sharp, and it is clearly one of the\nbest displays on smartphones in this price segment. Maintaining a perfect\nbalance, it is a crisp and vivid display without the colors looking\noversaturated.  \nConclusion :-Starting at \u20b96,999 ($108) for the base variant, the Redmi 4 ticks\nall the right boxes and there is hardly anything to complain. It\u2019s a great\npackage with solid chassis, Qualcomm\u2019s newer chipset, decent camera, and great\nbattery life.

Much like the Redmi\n3S, the Redmi 4 features a 5-inch screen. The new model, however, is slightly\nthicker at 8.65mm and heavier at 150 grams. The Redmi 3S measured 8.5mm and\nweighed at 144 grams. Overall the increase in thickness or weight doesn't\nchange much for the Redmi 4 as the phone is still quite usable with just one\nhand, and in fact fits better in the hand than the outgoing model.  \nI had no problem reaching the Redmi 4 fingerprint sensor at any time. The\nphone has only one Mi logo on the rear, but there's also a \"Designed by Xiaomi\n/ Assembled in India\" statement embossed in tiny letters. We like the\nattention detail, such as a protective ring around the camera lens.  \n  \nThe power and volume buttons are on the right, and are easily accessible when\nusing the phone with just one hand. There is a Micro-USB port for charging and\ndata transfers on the bottom, with grilles on either side, though only one of\nthem is actually a speaker. The 3.5mm audio socket and an Infrared emitter can\nbe found on the top.  \n  \nRedmi 4's navigation buttons are placed right below the screen but they aren't\nbacklit, which means locating them in the dark is tough.The notification LED\nis right below the Home button and is bright enough to alert users about\nincoming notifications. Much like other Redmi smartphones, the new Redmi 4\nalso has a hybrid dual-SIM tray, which means that you will have to decide\nwhether to use two SIM cards or one SIM along with a microSD card.  \nYou get standard set of documents, a data cable, a power adaptor, and a SIM\nejector tool along with the phone itself in the retail box.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 specifications and software  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 features a 5-inch HD (720x1280) IPS display with 2.5D curved-\nedge glass. This seems to be the first time that Xiaomi is using 2.5D glass on\na Redmi smartphone priced below Rs. 10,000. There's a non-removable 4100mAh\nbattery which is the same capacity as the Redmi 3S's battery, and is being\npromoted as one of this phone's highlights. The phone is powered by an octa-\ncore Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. There are three\nvariants of the Redmi 4: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage; one with 3GB\nof RAM and 32GB of storage; and finally 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. Our\nreview unit had 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Redmi 4 supports\nexpandable storage using a microSD card (up to 128GB).  \n  \nYou get a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED\nflash. There's also a 5-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. The new\nRedmi 4 will support 4G and VoLTE along with other connectivity options. When\ntwo SIM cards are used, only the primary one will allow 4G calls and data\nwhile the secondary SIM falls back to 2G calls only.  \nThe phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with Xiaomi's MIUI 8.2 skin. This\nis a stable build which is identical to what we saw on the Redmi Note 4 and\nRedmi 4A. This means that the Redmi 4 has a lot of software features that we\nhave already seen, including Dual Apps, which lets you create a second\ninstance of any app and supports Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and\nmore. The Quick Ball feature lets users assign shortcuts for features. One-\nhanded mode shrinks the display to one corner of the screen so that\neverything's easier to reach. The phone also gets a scrolling screenshot\nfeature that will let you take screenshot of an entire Web page. Child Mode\nlets users lock apps, and Second Space creates a separate profile to help\nusers manage business and personal data on the same device.  \n  \nThis version of MIUI looks cleaner and more polished than previous versions.\nYou can read about the software in more detail in our reviews of the Xiaomi\nRedmi Note 4 and Xiaomi Redmi 4A.  \n  \nIn keeping with previous Redmi phones, the Redmi 4 also packs lots of\npreinstalled apps such as Music, Mi Picks, Mi Community, News, Security,\nNotes, Recorder, and Weather. The Themes app lets users select themes,\nwallpapers, ringtones, and fonts from a store. There's also a dedicated Mi\nStore app on the device through which users can buy Xiaomi products and\naccessories. We believe that the MIUI interface could become lighter with the\nremoval of some of this bloatware, but not all of them can be deleted and they\ntake up valuable storage space on the device. There are also some preinstalled\nthird-party apps including Amazon, PhonePe Wallet, Flipkart, Facebook, and\nSwiftKey.  \n  \nUsers will get up to 5GB of free Mi Cloud storage when they sign in with a Mi\naccount, which is additional to the 15GB of free cloud storage that's offered\nby Google with every Gmail sign-in.  \nI was disappointed to see that the Redmi 4 does not run Android 7.0 Nougat,\nnor did it support Google Assistant at the time of review. On long-pressing\nthe home button, the Now on Tap feature for context-based searches is\ntriggered. Xiaomi says that the Redmi 4 will receiving an update to Nougat,\nand we might get Google Assistant before that, but no timeline has been\npromised by the company.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 camera  \nThe 13-megapixel rear camera is quick at focusing thanks to the phase\ndetection autofocus feature. The camera app also has a face recognition\nfeature that can come in handy. Compared to the Redmi 3S Prime, we found that\nautofocus on the Redmi 4 was a bit quicker. Camera samples were detailed and\nsharp, with colours that were vibrant and truly popped. Landscapes had\naccurate colours for the most part as well as reasonable detail. Macro or\nclose-up shots had a slight haze when seen full-size on a desktop monitor,\nthough the HDR mode helped to some extent.  \n  \nUnfortunately, turning HDR mode on made image capturing and processing really\nslow, and this is one of our biggest complaints with the device. With HDR on,\nusers need to be steady for a few seconds to get a good shot, or else photos\ncome out looking awful.  \n  \nThe rear camera has a tendency to capture a lot of noise when there is no\ndirect light source. Some camera sample shots taken in the dark were very\npoorly defined and had too much motion blur. At night, the Redmi 4 managed to\ntake good photos only when we were close to the subject under a light source\nsuch as a streetlamp.  \nThe Redmi 4's camera app is minimalistic and easy to use, with controls for\nvarious settings and features occupying only a small part of the screen. HDR\nmode is just a tap away, as are the live filters. The phone can record video\nat 720p and 1080p, and the videos came out decent overall.  \n  \nSelfies on the Redmi 4 can be an issue if you want a candid one, again because\nimage processing is slow.  \nOverall, the Xiaomi Redmi 4's cameras are definitely an improvement over those\nof the Redmi 3S Prime (Review), in terms of focusing and results. There are\nfew issues like poor low-light shots and slow processing in HDR mode, which we\nhope can be fixed - or at least improved upon - with updates.  \n  \nXiaomi Redmi 4 performance  \n  \nGeneral performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 is decent, and the device handled\nmost tasks well. The MIUI interface at times felt sluggish, but this doesn't\naffect performance within apps such as when playing games such as Asphalt 8\nand Cut the Rope 2. We had no major concerns during the entire review period.\nThere was also no noticeable overheating.  \nVoice call quality was decent, and the phone supports VoLTE. The phone doesn't\nship with a headset, so we checked the sound quality using our own earphones,\nand were quite impressed. You get several options to tweak music with the Mi\nSound Enhancer feature when using earphones. The Redmi 4 was also able to play\nour assortment of test videos with ease.  \nThe 5-inch IPS display is bright and text appears sharp. The screen is crisp\nwith decent viewing angles. However, this isn't the best HD display we've seen\non a Redmi phone. Colour reproduction is decent, but in our opinion, the Redmi\n3S was better. The screen was readable and usable under direct sunlight.\nMovies and games look good on the 5-inch display, though some might prefer a\nbigger screen. There's a Reading mode on the device that reduces background\nglare. Users can manually control colours and saturation on the device through\nthe Settings app.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 scored 43,677 in AnTuTu and 22,996 in Quadrant. We also ran\n3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench, where the phone scored 5,890 points and\n25fps respectively. These scores are on par with those of other phones powered\nby the Snapdragon 430 processor.  \n  \nThe Redmi 4 lasted for 14 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test,\nwhich is impressive. We can partly credit the battery loop test performance to\nthe low-impact HD screen resolution. With regular use, the battery lasted over\na day. There are also power saving modes to help squeeze more life out of each\ncharge. The phone doesn't come with a fast charging adapter but Xiaomi's Jai\nMani told us that it does support fast charging. We can expect Xiaomi to sell\na fast charging adapter for the Redmi 4 as an optional accessory, or you could\nbuy a third-party one.  \n  \nVerdict  \nIn the past, Xiaomi's Redmi models have set the standard for other phones in\nthe same price segment, and have also showed just how much a budget smartphone\ncan be capable of. The same holds true for the all-new Redmi 4. Xiaomi's\nlatest entry in the Redmi range manages to tick all the right boxes when it\ncomes to performance, battery life, and design. Camera quality is one aspect\nof performance that this phone lacks in, but then again we can't expect too\nmuch at these prices.  \n  \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 4 will replace the Redmi 3S (and Redmi 3S Prime) over time,\nand will become the company's main offering  \nIf you find this helpful then please hit that helpful button to encourage and\nsupport me.\n\n", "I was waiting to get my hands on the budget phones launched by Xiaomi. After\ngifting the redmi note series phones to my family, I was on a lookout for a\nnew phone for my mother. Before buying an electronic product, everyone carries\nout a research at their own level. For me the secondary research works best.\nThe problem with Chinese handsets is that they have different SOCs for\ndifferent markets. Hence you have to look out for the correct unit that is\nused in the review, especially the video reviews. Surprisingly enough all the\nreviews that I watched were very positive. The only thing was to carry out the\nHerculean task of ordering one phone on the flash sale.  \nBut that too was easy this time.  \nGood things about the phone:  \n1) Build quality: premium looking matches with my iPhone 7. I think it is\nhighly inspired from the design of the 7.  \n2) Camera: Compared with other phones below 10k, it performs much better when\ncompared with its counterparts.  \n3) Software/OS: It has the MUI 8 which is snappy and will be soon released on\nAndroid Nougat. The good thing about Mi brand is that the developer community\nis thriving especially for the themes.  \nAlso, the phone doesn't have shit apps which make your life hell.  \n4) Fingerprint sensor: If an average user now expects every phone to have a\nfinger printing scanner in their phone these days, the credit goes to Xiaomi.\nThey have launched such functionalities that used to be hard to imagine in a\nbelow 10k smartphone.  \n5) Battery: The unit houses a gigantic battery, that is more than enough for\nan average user. It is enough for a heavy user. I know the woes of a short\nbackup battery. But this phone easily runs for two days, once charged. The\nonly point of inconvenience is that it doesn't support fast charging which\nmakes sense to me. I mean if you have such a massive battery you wouldn't run\nout of it every now and then and thus no need for a fast charging.  \n  \nI think the only thing that is worth mentioning is that though the unit has a\nCorning Gorilla glass, you still need to be careful. I would hate to cover\nthat beautiful curved screen with a guard but since we don't know about the\nspecifics it is worth keeping under a screen guard.  \n  \nHope this review helps you in arriving at a decision.  \n  \nThanks for reading,  \nHave a good one.\n\n", "Product is as expected, Fast delivery by Amazon.  \n  \nPerformance:-  \n  \nGreat performance as expected from the Mi family. Powered by the Qualcomm\nSnapdragon 435 Octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz and coupled with Adreno\n505 GPU, this phone comes in three memory variants:  \n  \n1) 2 GB RAM along with 16 GB internal storage  \n2) 3 GB RAM along with 32 GB internal storage  \n3) 4 GB RAM along with 64 GB internal storage.  \n  \nI haven\u2019t really encountered any sluggishness or lags using the second\nvariant. Smooth performance is delivered. The top spec's variant offers just\nthe right balance of performance at the price range.  \n  \nCamera:-  \n  \nOutdoor in daylight, the phone really gives us with details it manages to\ncapture and overall clarity.  \n  \nIn low light, the camera clicks some decent shots, but there\u2019s a lot of noise\nin the pictures.  \n  \nDisplay:-  \n  \nIt has a 5-inch HD display with a 1280 x 720 resolution. The images and text\nlooks sharp. In this price range its a great display although you will be\nmissing the Gorilla Glass.  \n  \nBattery:-  \n  \nA day and a half on a single charge is easily manageable on a normal use and a\nday of charge on a moderate to higher usage.  \n  \nSoftware:-  \n  \nIt runs MIUI 8 on top of Android Marshmallow out of the box. It's totally\ndifferent UI altogether than stock Android but you will get used to it after\nusing it for a while.  \n  \nXiaomi delivers another promising phone with a top spot in terms of sales at\nthis price range. If you\u2019re planning to pick up a budget smartphone right now,\nit\u2019s hard to look further than Redmi 4. Just go for it.  \n  \nI was tight on budget and hence bought the second variant, but if you can up\nyour budget by \u20b91000, the top spec's variant at \u20b99,499 is the best pick of the\nthree since it offers just the right balance of performance and price.  \n  \nProduct Rating:- 4.5/5 (Cannot select 4.5 stars though)\n\n", "Okay....I have been a long time iphone user and have been a self declared\napple fanboy....  \n  \nI wanted to buy a second phone, but on the Android platform and after a long\nand exhaustive research decided to go for the redmi 4, 3gb ram option....  \n  \nHonestly, I didn't have any expectations from it.....  \n  \nBut...this phone blew me away...  \n  \nThe look and feel, the price, the performance, the features...this phone is\n\"da bomb\"...  \n  \nI honestly love this phone for the superb user friendly features like finger\nprint scanner, one hand operation, dual apps, second space, the camera and the\ninbuilt filters which are very instagrammy....  \n  \nWhat I love....
