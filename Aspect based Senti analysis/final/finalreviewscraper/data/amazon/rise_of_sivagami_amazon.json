It's a different kind of challenge\nand that's why I like the idea of writer and the Franchise owners to create a\nprequel series of the Movie. Baahubali is a worldwide phenomena now so\nobviously they had to create something on quite a large scale (somewhat\nsimilar to the movies) with major involvement of few of the on screen famous\ncharacters to cash in their popularity but at the same time it had to be\ninteresting and unique. Well! they succeeded at almost every front except the\none which was most important - \"Uniqueness\". Right from the characters to\nplots or even the writing style, everything is very much inspired from A Song\nof Ice and Fire. Just to give you an idea-  \n  \nShivagami: A fierce young girl Her father was a good man but branded as\ntraitor and executed by king so she swear to destroy the royal family. She\nacted as a lone wolf and tried to overcome all the odds by herself. There were\ntimes when she was trying to hide her fear and was thinking about the lessons\nfrom his uncle/mentor to keep her calm, I can almost read the famous line\n\"Fear cuts deeper than swords\" in those paras. Ring any bells? Yeah! She is\nthe Arya Stark of Mahishmathi.  \n  \nSkandadasa: Probably the only decent man in King's court He became\nMahapradhana (as good as King's Hand) in the later part of the book. He is a\nkindhearted and just person devoted to his country and strictly against the\ncorrupt men and wrong and biased practices and traditions. This is the reason\nfew other politically influential people dislike him. He is clearly the Eddard\nStark of this story with some small revisions.  \n  \nHidumba: A politically powerful dwarf A loudmouth but a man with important\nconnections, always involved in the major events and conspiracies of\nMahishmathi. He is so similar to Tyrion Lannister that I always read his\ndialogue in Peter Dinklage's voice in my head.  \n  \nVaithalikas: A community claims to be the actual owner of Gauriparvat and\nMahishmathi, they are ferocious fighters and have an uncrowned king of their\nown. They are the Targaryens (but without dragons) of this series .  \n  \nBrihannala: A Eunuch(???) S/he is conspiring something big in league with\nVaithalikas. Baahubali's version of Varys  \n  \nPattaraya: A great strategist, his ultimate aim is to overthrow the kingdom\nbut he sets smaller goal to avoid suspicion; and though he don't have the\nultimate controls on brothels but he used them for his plans in similar ways\nas Petyr Baelish did in aSoIaF.  \n  \nSimilarly the kingdom has 2 princes, Elder one Bijjaladev is very cruel and\nspoiled same as Joffrey while the younger one Mahadeva isn't a great warrior,\nkindhearted but gullible at the same time. He certainly reminds you of Tommen.  \n  \nGundu Ramu: A fat coward boy but a loyal friend of one of the main characters.\nHe couldn't be more like Samwell.  \n  \nAchi Nagamma: The one who's independent of any banner and fighting for poor,\nhelpless and needy villagers. She is leading the all women vigilante army and\nmore like a female version of Beric Dondarrion  \n  \nApart from the above mentioned characters and plot similarities the writing\nstyle is also similar to aSoIaF and though it is interesting to have chapters\nfrom different characters' point-of-view but its not as effective as it was in\naSoIaF series. The main reason is sheer plot vastness of aSoIaF, \"George RR\nMartin\" has a much bigger universe than \"Anand Neelakantan\" so his each\ncharacter's story POV take you to almost entirely different part of the seven\nkingdoms while in this novel even with so many different characters almost the\nentire story is set in Mahismathi it self. GRRM never mixed 2 POVs in single\nchapter but that had happened quite a few times here. Also almost half of the\nchapters (barring the climax and few others in between) don't have that many\npages so as soon as the momentum is building up the chapter ends. Plus there's\na lot of sexual content but it's not as justified as it was in GRRM's\ncreation.  \n  \nBut all these things doesn't mean that this book is not interesting. For me it\nis something like Eragon Series \"inspired from few great hits but still worth\nreading\". As I said, with the Baahubali book series they had the luxury of few\nwell known and wildly loved/hated characters in the form of Shivagami,\nKattappa & Bijjaladev and they have utilized them beautifully. Also after\ninitial similarities/inspirations the book takes it's own story forward, which\nis fast paced and full of turns and twists. I specially loved the last few\nchapters related with Mahamakam and the final twists in the last page leave\nyou awestruck. I have read in the acknowledgements that Anand finished this\nbook in 109 days which is quite unbelievable because it never gives you the\nfeeling of a book finished in hurry, even if you consider the inspirations\nfrom other books.  \n  \nOverall it's a good effort and now after initial built-up I expect better and\nmore original content from next 2 books of the series. Looking forward to it\n\n", "What does this book have that the movie Bahubali doesn't?  \n  \nThe very beginning! The past. The life of Sivagami and the way she has become\nthe way she is.  \n  \nAnand Neelakantan weaves a beautiful story of Sivagami in midst of the\ngeographical, social and cultural milieu of Mahishmati empire. Sivagami's\ncircumstances, her traversing through the myriad shades of the Mahishmati\nempire, the political cauldron and the social structure - all seems to\nresonate with the reader as one progresses in reading the book.  \n  \nTo understand the movie much better, do read this book, for it shall complete\nyour understanding of the story of Bahubali. \u00a0Sivagami undergoes the whole\nrigmarole of \u00a0getting the things set right for herself and in the process of\nher expedition leads to interesting discoveries. Interestingly these\ndiscoveries are known to the reader and not to the various characters in the\nbook.  \n  \nThe narrative flow of the book is good and Anand keeps the reader engaged\nexcept for a certain slowness in the story in between. This lull effect is\ngood in a way since we get to process all the information in the story till\nthat point. (It could be a damper for some)  \n  \nThis is first part of the series on Sivagami and am looking forward to the\nnext book.\n\n", "The author is a best selling author from Kerala state of India. Known for his\nprevious super hits like Asura- The Tale of the Vanquished and Ajaya Series of\nbooks, he ventured into this ambitious prequel to recent historic Indian\nblockbuster movie \u201cBahubali\u201d directed by SS Rajamouli of Andhra Pradesh. Known\nfor his fiction writing skills, the author remains as the darling of epic\nfiction lovers of the country.  \nStoryline:  \nThe story begins with the woes of the downtrodden in the mighty kingdom of\nMaahishmati, somewhere in the central part of India, near the Mahishi river,\nprotected by their revered sacred mountain called Gauri Parvat. Sivagami, a\nyoung lady in her teens , whose father has been killed by the orders of the\nking for treason and treachery, is admitted into the royal orphanage, by her\nUncle. She under immense pressure and vengeance to destroy the royal lineage\nof Maahishmati patiently waits in the orphanage, only to be unexpectedly be\ncourted by the Prince Mahadeva, younger brother of the aggressive and cruel\ncrown prince Bijjala Deva. The later being an arrogant, tyrant, evil and a\nwomanizer, always treats his subjects as slaves and is highly feared and hated\namongst his peer groups. His slave Kattappa, a die-hard duty bound and loyal\nservant always protects Bijjala Deva from many threats and dangers that the\nlater faces in his day to day life, but is never respected in return.\nMeanwhile, some of the evil noblemen of the kingdom like Pattaraya wants to\nprofit by smuggling the secret Gauri dhooli, a strange powder extracted from\nthe self glowing blue and rare Gauri Kanta stones, mined from the womb of\nGauri Parvat, to the enemy vassal states of Maahishmati. The generations old\nsecret of Maahishmati\u2019s undefeated victory saga in wars is attributed to its\nweapons moulded with mixture of Gauridhooli and metal. Sivagami, the highly\ncommitted and talented girl accidentally saves the life of the king Somadeva\nfrom a sudden coup attempt by the rebel Vaithalikas, on the auspicious\nMahamaakam festival day, just at the time when she attempts to recover the\nsecret book of her father, written in a strange ancient language, from the\nchambers of the Prime Minister, Skandadasa. The story ends here with Sivagami\nrewarded with the title of a Bhoomipathi and her father\u2019s treachery forgiven\nfor her act, surprising her totally and giving her a chance to be in the\ngoverning system and thus plot to destroy the kingdom in the future.  \nPros : The book is cleverly plotted with umpteen number of characters in a\nseries of events right from the beginning till the end. The author\u2019s skill to\nmanoeuvre the reading is well maintained. The way in which lower castes and\npeasants were treated in the ancient kingdoms wherein only the upper castes\nand royal family reaped the benefits while the former always suffered and\nforced to a life full of sheer poverty, slavery, insults, homicide, genocide,\nchild trafficking and forced prostitution is well elicited. The author was\nsuccessful in portraying that such blind dictatorship rule of any country\nwould lead to revolt and coups somewhere or the other. The effect of Bahubali\nmovie on the book seemed to be very high as the reader , if already watched\nthe movie, would correlate each and every character of the book with the real\nmovie characters as long as he/she is reading, in the back of his/her mind.  \nCons: The story started with a bang but somehow there is some loss of lustre\nin the first half with some boredom masking the story but picked up pace after\nthe middle and maintained the tempo till the end. Since it is the Book One of\nthe series, many characters in the story have been left unfinished. I find\nthat there are too many characters introduced but hope that they will find\ntheir life in the next book. Somehow, the actual historic movie Bahubali 1 and\n2 seem to have shielded the overall effect of the book. Slightly felt that the\nbook would have had a greater punch if it was written and released even before\nthe movie. Some negligible print errors are spotted here and there.  \n  \nMy rating of this book is 3.25 out of 5\n\n", "I picked up \"The Rise of Sivagami (Baahubali: Before the Beginning #1)\" by\nAnand Neelakantan, as it was a prequel to the movie Bahubali. But the best way\nto enjoy this book is to forget the movie plot & read the book as a\nstandalone. This will help you connect better to the multiple plots &\ninteresting characters.  \n  \nThe story revolves around love, greed, revolts, revenge, honour, power,\npolitics & prostitution. This book is well paced & keeps you engaged +\nguessing the next plot...  \n  \nIf you want to get a deeper insight into the characters of Bahubali, then it\u2019s\na must read & just like the movie leaves you at the end of the book guessing\nthe next plots... how did Sivagami end up marrying the beast Bijjala? What is\nBrihanala up to? Why was Sivagami's father branded a traitor?  \n  \nBahubali: Before the Beginning #2, I am waiting for you....\n\n", "The Rise of Sivagami: Book 1 of\u00a0Baahubali - Before the Beginning\u00a0is an amazing\nbook.  \nThe Rise of Sivagami is an excellent story, The author have canvassed the rise\nof the the queen beautifully. You will definitely enjoy reading the book. A\nmust buy for novel readers. Although the book is not written in English type\nof novels, but definitely it is one of the best novel. If you are in bangalore\nand a regular bus traveler, then it is a nice book to go for it.\n\n", "Book 1  \n~Bahubali Before The Beginning~  \nTHE RISE OF SIVAGAMI BY ANAND NEELAKANTAN  \n  \nThis novel talks about everything that happened before the beginning of\nBahubali. The story is centred around Sivagami, the future queen of\nMahishmathi. It depicts the story when Sivagami was a teenage girl. As in all\nthe Bahubali movies this story also has many characters, which makes it more\ninteresting for the readers.  \n  \nThis story is about how Sivagami became a part of the palace officials. In\nthis story, Sivagami hates Mahishmathi and it's king Maharaj Somdeva since her\nfather was been executed by him for treason. This is about her journey from an\norphanage to becoming a bhoomipathi of Mahishmathi.  \n  \nYou will also read about Kattappa during his teenage life. You will come to\nknow about his family & how he became such a great warrior. The story depicts\nhis suffering & struggle to survive in this master & slave lifestyle. You will\nexperience how he has to take tough decisions in his life.  \n  \nYou will also come across Bijjaladeva & Mahadeva. You will come to know about\nPrince Mahadeva as you have hardly known about him from the movies.  \n  \nThe author has described the orthodox thinking in a brilliant manner, the\nmaster and slave lifestyle, the cast based designation and ill treatment that\nwas followed during the olden days. As you will expect from a Bahubali book,\nit has fighting and war scenes poured down brilliantly in terms of words.  \n  \nThe story is very interesting as Sivagami hates Mahishmathi then how she\nbecame the queen of Mahishmathi. The story ends at very interesting point\nwhere Sivagami is declared as a bhoomipathi which makes you think about will\nshe take her revenge or not, hence you will also be waiting for it's next\nedition.\n\n", "I have been a fan of Anand since the day I read Asura. Here I was, holding a\nbook that challenged everything I had learnt and seen on TV since I was\nlittle. His writing style, the narration and the way he weaved philosophy into\nthe story made the book unquestionably unputdownable.  \n  \nThe same is case with the first installment in the Baahubali series. I was\nreading this book every opportunity I had. Anand had ensured that the reader\nis engaged right from the first page of this book, all the way to the\nAcknowledgments. The characters came to life in my kindle and in my\nimagination, and I could feel the aspiration and tension of the characters in\nthe book.  \n  \nEagerly looking forward to the next 2 installments of this book\n\n", "I apparently saw and bought this book from Amazon because I liked the B\u0101hubali\nmovie series very much.... this book is tremendously exciting as many new\nfacts get out of envelope and engages you to keep on reading.... but at the\nsame time many sexual contents are there in the book which perhaps make you\nuneasy : (  \n  \nOverall if you want to indulge yourselves in the world of Mahishmati.... you\nshould buy this\n\n", "This undoubtedly is one of the most intriguing book I have ever read. It is a\nkind of book which you want to finish ASAP because you can't stop reading it\nat any point. It is wonderfully written. All the plots, characters, places are\nbeautifully crafted. We you finish this book you keep turning pages to see if\nthere is more as it leaves you on the edge. Can't wait to get my hands on book\n2 of this trilogy.  \nThis is the first book I have read by Mr Anand and I will make sure I read his\nother work soon.\n\n", "Multiple voices can be heard expressing their points of view in this story.\nThis gives the reader a broad overview of life on this fictional universe and\nat the same time tells him the deepest thoughts that motivate characters to do\nwhat they do or plan to do.  \nCharacters, male, female and other, who occupy different strata of the society\nthey live in give us a feeling that this is all real.  \nThere is action and sex, the former well written and the latter not so\ninteresting.  \nThe kingdom of Mahishmathi is the grand centre of power. As we have already\nseen this particular geographic entity and become familiar with the landscape\nin the two movies, a few descriptive passages by the author suffice to help us\nvisualize the background.  \nThe author tries to depict the complex inter play of good and evil in the\nindividual. Groups of men with various co des and morals, clash with one\nanother, sometimes reinstating their principles, and at other times reviewing\nthem.  \nThe main character shivagami is made distinct not only because of what she\nthinks and does but also because of how people look upto her, admire her and\nlove her.  \nThe author may have captured the attention of thousands of readers by writing\na book on a popular movie, but if people read this book from end to end its\nbecause of the authencity of his writing.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 6 June 2017", "on 14 July 2017", "on 7 July 2017", "on 27 January 2018", "on 15 June 2017", "on 6 October 2017", "on 15 June 2017", "on 8 June 2017", "on 20 June 2017", "on 16 July 2017"], "reviewer": ["Avinash Tiwari", "Kavita Singh", "THREEKAY", "Vasanth Naidu", "aswini", "Sheetal Naik", "VijayMenon", "Amazon Customer", "Ankur Baid", "Amazon Customer"]},

What happened at the prime ministers office at\nMahishmati, could have easily happened at any Gram Panchayat office today. The\nsorry state of government orphanages, the abuse of power, the twisting of\nfacts, paid bards and storytellers akin to todays paid media - deja vu.  \nThe only thing that is different is the slavery, for which we must ever be\ngrateful for our Independence.  \nAnand Neelakantan, Take a bow, Man!!!\n\n", "Mr. Neelakantan has written beautifully about the kingdom, their people, the\nrules, slaves, sivagami, her life and everything. The way he describes\nsituations places people and emotions is very unique and lively. The rise of\nsivagami however has many unanswered questions. I wouldn't want to ask those\nquestions in a public forum but they are significant. Without answers to those\nthe end is unconvincing. Perhaps the author will write another book which\nshows how sivagami becomes the powerful woman we see in the movie.
