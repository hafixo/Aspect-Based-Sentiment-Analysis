I'm really\nliking this cube for many features which resemble the famous Chinese DaYan or\nMoYu cubes. I'll mention all those features under Pros. I'm really loving to\nplay and practise with this one.  \nBy the way, at this price, the cube is really a very good and fun stuff.  \n  \nNow, heading to the.....  \n  \n|Product Description| :-  \n  \nThis cube comes in a thin plastic wrapper only with a price and mfg tag on it.\nThis cube is made up of lightweight plastic and is very colourful and shiny.\nIt has a \"Negi's\" logo on the yellow centre piece. Well, it also comes in a\nlittle pre-lubricated condition. Its design exactly resembles the famous\nChinese 'MoYu HuaLong' cubes' stickerless versions. Not only designs, but\nthere are many more interesting features, which will be discussed next under\nPros and Cons.  \n  \nAnyways, lets get into the Pros and Cons.....  \n  \n| Pros | :-  \n  \n1) It is naturally a speed cube. If customized properly and maintained from\ntime to time, it will work at Storm speed.  \n2) The screws of center pieces are adjustable, as well as, easy to adjust.  \n3) Spring tensions of this cube is really good.  \n4) It is completely stickerless. Even no tiles. All pieces are moulded\ncolourful plastics.  \n5) Turning is quiet smooth, even without lubrication.  \n6) Interlocking technology of cubicles is pretty good, which prevents popping\nout of pieces. Also corner twisting is very rare in this cube.  \n7) It is pretty lightweight and doesn't feel like a load on fingers.  \n8) Easy to disassemble.  \n9) The edges of pieces are straight slanted which helps in corner cutting.  \n10) Price is really cheap when these features are considered.  \n  \n| Cons | :-  \n  \n1) Its not very durable. Indeed it is weak as strength of plastic is not that\ngood.  \n2) It doesn't have its original packaging. Only comes in a thin wrapper and\nthat's disappointing !  \n3) The brand logo is painted with a really cheap paint. Wears off and vanishes\nwithin a few days.  \n4) Sometimes it causes serious inaccurate moves, if there's even a little\ndecrease in speed while continuously doing some Algorithms.  \n5) It doesn't come in a good pre-lubricated condition. It is very little\nlubricated, right after unboxing from package.  \n6) This cube gets stuck/jammed sometimes.  \n7) Corner cutting is not as desired of a good speed cube.  \n  \n(#) | Additional Pro Tips | :-  \n  \ni) Apply silicone oil lubricant thoroughly throughout the cube and joints for\nmaintenance and speed. Don't forget to clean the dusts and dirt before\nlubricating.  \nii) Adjust the spring tensions from time to time.  \niii) Avoid rough usage of the cube and hence by doing all the above the\nproblems of this cube can be solved and hence it will have a long life.  \n  \nThank You, for giving your valuable time to read this long review !  \n  \nIf you find it helpful, please let me know ( by hitting the 'Helpful' Button\n), so that I'll feel glad to write other reviews to keep helping customers.\n\n", "\n\n\u00a0Its really nice and fast you can go for it I HAVE SO MANY CUBES BUT THIS IS\nTHE BEST IN BUDGET nothing is bad its fast,smooth,glossy finished, AND NAGIS\nIS A GOOD AND TRUSABLE BRAND and the main thing that the logo of nagis get\nerased at very first day PLEASE SEE THE VIDEO IN MY REVIEW!!!!!!!***$\n\n", "RS Negi Speed Cube 3x3x3  \n  \n\\- Great Quality ;  \n\\- Sticker-less Cube ;  \n\\- Smooth and lubricated ;  \n\\- Value for money ;  \n\\- Easy to disassemble too , you\u2019d need to turn the top layer at 45 degree and\ntwist one of the edge and take it out \u2013 the remaining pieces will come out\neasily. Or you can check instructions for the same on google as well.  \n\\- The colors on this cube are : White x Yellow , Orange x Red , Green x Blue\n;  \n\\- The white center piece has a logo of RS Negi on it ;  \n\\- The lubrication reduces with time and it doesn\u2019t remain as smooth as it\nused to be in the beginning.

Even though he is not able solve\nit completely sometime. It's helping me lot. Also you can check out dis-\nassemble & assemble videos. Soon I will add here, If I'm able to do it.

Instead of letting them to Stare TV\nall the time.  \n  \nIt's worth the price hand down, be sure checkout during deals, You might get\nit for below 100 Rs/-.

Sticker less and good quality...\n\n", "Product I received had scratches on it. It is probably used one. Also the\ncolours are not same as on the product page.
