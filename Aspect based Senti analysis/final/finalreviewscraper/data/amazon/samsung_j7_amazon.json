Here's the review  \nPros:  \nDual sim slot with additional memory card slot - big wow...i till date have\nnot been able to understand why the so called advanced versions come with\nalternate second sim slot cause one needs extra memory given the kind of junk\nwe put in our phones needs more memory.  \nRemovable battery - another wow..i have an A8 as well and its known fact that\nafter a year battery trouble starts..with non removable battery phones its\nimpossible to get battery replaced unless you visit authorised dealer and\nguess what they have said it takes 3 months or more to get the battery\nreplaced for A8.  \nSoftware upgradable version - well this was a surprise...i didnt know this\nmodel comes in two variants..one with and one without auto software upgradable\nmode...luckily mine is auto so i get best of the upgrades  \nBatery backup & charging time - battery lasts about 2 days with medium usage\nwithout gaming...which for me is good...charging time with original charger\nfor fully disposed battery is 2.5 hours...which is fantastic...however i\nhaven't got the same result using other chargers  \nCons:  \nWeight - this is a heavy phone given the hardware is 2 years old  \nLook & feel - basic look with no jaz...full plastic finish...so no where close\nto the sophisticated metal finished models  \nScreen & display - screen is ok with ok resolution display...once again in\ncomparison to 30k plus models  \nOverall-for someone using a phone for the purpose of it with being on track\nwith most of utility apps without lag or hanging issues..this comes as the\ncheapest option with the punch of performance. I bought a total of 4 phones\nfor the family and haven't heard anyone complain so far\n\n", "good phone , camera is not very good, battery ok , no hanging problem\n\n", "Super phone\n\n", "Box delivered completely sealed.
