The device writes at 4 to 6 MB/s maximum (using a\nWindows 10 laptop with i7 5500U CPU, Nvidia GTX 940M GPU, and 16GB RAM, with\nthe drive plugged in a USB 3 port). The drive tends to heat up during\noperation which my older cruzerblade doesn't. The older 8GB cruzerblade stays\ncool even when used constantly for moving data (hours at a time), but this new\ndrive heats up within 10 minutes of ANY read/write operation using the same\npair of computers. The good news (I guess) is that I have an HP w220v flash\ndrive and that heats up as well- it's been heating up for like 4 years, and it\nstill works- heat will probably not damage the device (unless it's heating\nlike a stove,, which it isn't).  \n  \nTHE UGLY: The seller called me and asked me to cancel the order, claiming his\nwarehouse has burned down and if he cancels the order on his own he will be\n\"fined\" by Amazon for not fulfilling his commitment. This is very weird- I've\nbeen shopping online for years and no seller has ever called me up. I called\nAmazon to check, Amazon customer care asked me not to cancel the order. I did\nnot cancel and the product was eventually delivered (before promised date).\nThis was an unique incident, and the chances of this repeating with your order\nis infinitesimally small.  \n  \nUSABLE CAPACITY: 14.5 GB  \n  \nBOTTOM LINE: At this price, you cannot lose. Even if it goes bad, SanDisk is a\ngenuine brand and it comes with a 5 years warranty- you can always call up\nSanDisk and request assistance. Go for it.\n\n", "Hi Everyone, Today i am gonna review  \nSandisk Cruzer Blade 16gb , Purchased on 10th August,2017 AT 349INR.  \nI TESTED it properly Here is my Full Review.  \n  \nBuild Quality of this product : 2.5 * out of 5. ( Plastic Port is too thin)  \n  \nQuality of the Product : 3* out of 5.  \n  \nTransfer Rate : 3* out of 5. ( 4-5 mb/ps)  \n  \nValue for money : 4* out of 5.(cheapest in 16gb categories)  \n  \nADVANTAGES :  \n  \nI gave 4* for Value for money. Because  \n  \n1- It is around 350 rupees in 16 gb..may be the cheapest.  \n  \n2- 5 years warranty / Garente .  \n  \n3- Light weight. Easy to carry.  \n  \n4- No heating Issues.  \n  \nProblem of this Product / Suggestions if you already brought it :  \n  \n1- Transfer rate is average . Starting with 40 mb/ps to it reduce to 3.5mb/ps.\nAnd the average is 4-5mb/ps. Which is little slow.  \n  \n2- You have to be careful always because the port build quality is very very\nthin. It may break with little force also. use wisely.  \n  \n3- Not suitable For heavy users. Those who always use for heavy transfer ,\nsorry this pendrive is not for you. Especially college guys. Try HP 16gb .  \n  \n4- you have to keep it carefully ,if you will get a crack on this your\nwarranty will not be accepted. Too thin .  \n  \n5- Use Only for minimum purposes .just like for print out a document. Or some\ne books.  \nSo for Office Purpose its okey. Students are heavy users .They always transfer\nGames, Movies etc etc. so Big no for them. Spend a little more and get Hp one,\nyou will get more transfer speed...you will be happy. But for Office use or\nminimum users this product is best at this price.  \n  \nOverall My Rating is 3*. It could have been more good if the transfer rate\nwould be little higher. 4-5 mb/ps speed is not good at all. Just an average.  \n  \nThanks guys for Reading my Reveiw .Have a beautiful day ahead.

The delivery service and the seller's\nservice do deserve special compliments. This works perfectly and awesomely.\nThis one really is a great product. Especially when having a price tag of\n\u20b9285.00. Through my constant experiments on this \u201cSanDisk Cruzer Blade\nSDCZ50-016G-135 16GB USB 2.0 Pen Drive\u201d, I had came to some inferences. I'm\nsharing that info with you all through this review.  \nI'm expressing my views about this product point-by-point and will try my best\nto shorten it. So that, you could grasp the idea in it simply and easily.  \n\u201cAll the views expressed in this review are solely my own.\u201d  \n  \n\u2022 PROS \u2022  \n  \n\u221a. Cool, stylish and compact design.  \n\u221a. Very handy.  \n\u221a. Less weight (9 grams).  \n\u221a. Dimension [size] is perfect (5.6 x 3.6 x 1 cm).  \n\u221a. Will fit in your pockets.  \n\u221a. So comfortable to use.  \n\u221a. The Black & Red combination is very cool.  \n\u221a. Back up, sharing and transferring files is now in your hands.  \n\u221a. Now you can carry your essentials, wherever you go.  \n\u221a. Made up of plastic material.  \n\u221a. Shows enough speed as expected (USB v2.0).  \n\u221a. Easy to share files between computers, laptops, etc.  \n\u221a. Also, you are able to share the files with your tablets or smartphones,\nwith the support of an otg adapter.  \n\u221a. Comes up with a built-in SanDisk Secure Access software.  \n\u221a. This product has 5 years manufacturer warranty.  \n\u221a. Worth every penny, you spend to buy it.  \n  \n\u2022 CONS \u2022  \n  \nx. No light indicators.  \nx. Continues use of about 10 minutes or more will start to produce heat in it.  \nx. Connector is made up of plastic material (careless use may broke it), not\nmade of metal.  \nx. This only comes with a USB v2.0 interface.  \n  \n\u2022 VERDICT \u2022  \n  \nThis product is so cool & comfy to use. The colour combination is the one\nthat, highly attracted me. I really appreciate SanDisk for introducing the\nbuilt-in security application in their pendrive(s). The size, shape, design\namd all such things needs special compliments. All the PROS makes this small\none a big one.  \nNow saying about the CONS; don't expect a 'notification light' feature, for\nthis price tag. The connector part (plastic material) may broke, if it is used\ncarelessly. So, give care to that thing. This product is with USB v2.0\ninterface, which is getting outdated. Technology has gone a long way, and so\nSanDisk too. So, now pendrives with higher interface is available. If you need\nhigh speed, I would probably suggest you to go for higher interfaces (such USB\nv3.0 or USB v3.1). The one that I hated the most, in this item is the 'heating\nproblem' in it. I think, SanDisk might have forgotten to focus on that aspect.\nAnd also, I hope that, SanDisk will fix a \u2018band-aid\u2019 to that problem in the\nfuture.  \nExcept the CONS, the product is one big piece of mass. I personally like this\nproduct a lot. This product is just enough, to satisfy your needs to store\nyour essential files.  \n  \n\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b  \nPlease review the images for more info  \n\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b  \n  \n\u2267\u25e0\u25e1\u25e0\u2266 I HOPE YOU FOUND MY REVIEW HELPFUL.

Amazon didn't allowed ! so here we go from box\nto operation (for old buddies) ; 1.receive delivery, open package ,find the\nproduct ,check its code and accept the product (and make the payment) 2.cut it\nwith the scissor marks only (and don't spoil the packing, it can be used for a\nlong time) and with the help of the two finger ,with a little care and trick,\ntake it out. 3.Pc's anti virus ready for a removable drive scan, pc connected\nto internet for latest driver installation and automatic installation is\nactive in device installation settings. 4 then insert it into the usb 2.0 port\ngently with the name SanDisk on the top. 5 within seconds ''the driver is\ninstalled and device is ready to use\" message appears. 6 now, antivirus scans\nit and hopefully its clear. 7.now check it for the errors. right click upon\nthe sandisk/pen drive icon and go to properties at bottom and click it. my 16\ngb pendrive shows capacity as 14.5gb (EFFECTIVE)! 8.move to the next section\n'TOOLS' at the top and go for the \"Check now' (radio) button and hopefully,\neverything is good. 9.now the pendrive can be used for storage purposes. make\nat least a single folder in the pendrive,preferably. now drag any item from\nany location window and drop to the new folder window in the pendrive or just\ncopy and paste. 10 additionally, in the Property box, there is also a tab\n'ReadyBoost\" (wow ! my pc has checked the device and found that it can be used\nfor ready boost! when its only USB 2.0 ! ) readyboost can really boost your\nsystem with HDD and low RAM. the box further asks you to dedicate the pendrive\nfor readyboost or allot at least 4gb = 4096mb for the readyboost to work\neffectively or not to use it for readyboost at all ! if you don't want to use\nit for readyboost, just don't do there anything in the readyboost tab. Mind\nthat the space you allocate for readyboost can't be used for storage purposes.\nyou can use 32 gb for readyboost @ maximum on each pen drive and you can add 8\nsuch pendrives @ max to a single Pc. 11.apart from storage and readyboost,\nthese usb drives can also be made bootable. i mean you can also use them to\ninstall windows,etc or start a pc with them.etc, etc. Believe me installing\nwindows,etc with pendrives is a lot faster than with a installation dvd and\nwhere pen drive's life is 5 year and we all know about a dvd's life. all the\nmore external/ internal dvd writers life is hardly two years now a days. an\nexternal dvd writer in the price band of 1500/- to 2000/- is mostly assured of\n1 year life (only TRANSCEND assures 2 year life in that price band). what we\nhave to do is just find a suitable installer for an app .there are tools to\nmake multiboot pendrives. RAYMOND CC is a very good search site for advance\nuses which is secured by NORTON and provides a lot of safe download sites\nwhich you can instantly check with VIRUS TOTAL! 12. back to our task , check\nthe drive for ten days return period and then register it with SanDisk and get\na 5 year warranty/ guarantee.13 CAUTION: dont just pullout the pendrive to\ndetach it from Pc ! data loss may happen. always remove removable storage\nsafely. there will be a a green lock in the 'Task Bar' @ bottom and near the\nright corner of the desktop.and when you hover mouse pointer/cursor over it,\nit would say 'safely remove hardware'. click it and a small box would say\n'safely remove USB Mass storage device' with the listing of removable drives.\nThere you have to select the drive and click it. then a window will appear\nsaying 'this device can now be safely removed from the computer' then you have\nto pull it out gently. otherwise there will be a message window saying that\n'the device cannot be detached' or 'some program is still using the device' or\nsomething like that. in that case make it sure that no program is using that\nfor eg copying , scanning, etc. finish the process(s) , save your work, come\nout and again start from the green lock. if you are not able to make out where\nit is being used or opened, don't panic but also don't pull it out. keep on\ndoing what you are doing save all your work and do a complete shut down and\nthen you can detach it with no fear. additionally, as i know if you are using\nit for readyboost, it would not be detachable in the middle and not even try\nto do that ! 14. i forgot to mention that there is also a special option in\nthe product. you can encrypt your data on it. it means you can block access to\nthat data by other users. therefore SanDisk has put one application Executable\nand one guide PDF (for the use of that application) on the pen drive. that PDF\nis for windows users. and mac users can download guide straight from the\nsecond PDF. i think its more useful for storage purposes.

I am using it for last 5\nmonths and till date not faced any trouble at all....... things i like about\nthis product:  \n1\\. It is by far the best USB 2.0 product at this price range....  \n2\\. Possibly the best in class device meant for rough usage....  \n3\\. Build quality is good & is extremely handy with no over-heating issues....  \n4\\. Compatible with windows 7, 8 & 8.1 (tested by me) and compatible with 3.0\nports as well...  \n5\\. Normally gives around 35 MB/s read speed with 3.0 (though the device is a\n2.0) which is just awesome...writing speed is around 5 MB/s...\n\n", "A exemplary pen drive for day to day storage use. Sleek and compact design.\nTransfer rate is satisfactory and easily gives 17 MB/sec. of speed. It was\ndelivered 2 days before the expected and arrived in just 2 days from the date\nof the order.

The reason for 4 stars is that the actual price\nmentioned on the product is 449 but the price mentioned on website is 649. Why\nthis cheating Amazon?\n\n", "Hello Buyers,  \nBefore going to this review, I try my best to give my review for this product\n. I buy this pendrive before 10 days. I really enjoy with this pendrive at\nthis price range. As this is a usb 2.0 (DDR3 SD)pendrive it transfers file\nupto the speed of 40-50 Mbps in my pc. This is quite good for usb 2.0 pendrive\nparticullary with this price range. Also speaking with its built quality i\ndropped 5 or 6 times at a height of around 50 ft but this pendrive works for\nme perfectly without any scratches. I feel good to recommmend this pendrive\nfor all peoples. You also feels happy with this pendrive performance.. Hope\nthis review is helpful, If you find this helpful hit the helpful button too!  \n  \nBuy AT :\u00a0SanDisk Cruzer Blade SDCZ50-016G-135 16GB USB 2.0 Pen Drive\n\n", "Working fine after almost one and a half years, So I guess it's quite good pen\ndrive. Max read speed is around 20~22 MBps and write speed sucks, depends on\nfile size and number of files etc, I've seen it doing 0.5~5MBps, but that's\nclose enough to USB 2.0 standards. Buy it if you don't plug it into PC every\nother minute.  \n  \nThe plastic body isn't that strong and plugging point has to be handed\ncarefully while inserting into port but it has lasted fairly rough plug-in\n/plug-outs so quite durable I guess.\n\n", "It may be easy om the pocket but it feels really clumsy . Made entirely from\nplastic. Every time you insert it in a laptop you will be paying that it won't\nbreak into pieces..  \n  \nYou might want to see the review pictures to see the scratches on the surface\nafter using it a just a day!  \n  \nPros :  \n1\\. Cheap,  \n2.highest capacity in it's price range  \n  \nCons:  \n1\\. Really weak body made with plastic entirely  \n2.USB 2.0 hence transfer super is very slow(but what more can you expect at\nthis price)\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 1 November 2017", "on 14 August 2017", "on 9 January 2018", "on 8 August 2017", "on 10 March 2018", "on 26 November 2017", "on 19 October 2015", "on 27 January 2017", "on 18 July 2017", "on 27 June 2017"], "reviewer": ["Srinivas nayak", "Gokila", "Rutvik", "RRC", "Ankur Shahi", "LEO OOMMEN KURIAN", "Shubham", "Aravind Naveen", "Harshiv Patel", "Amazon Customer"]}
