It's convenient, safe, lasts long and costs\nright.  \n  \nFull review below:  \n  \nPros:  \n-Lasts 45mins with one charge so you can use it multiple times by changing once.  \n-The dial has 1-10 adjustable cover. You can't ask for more. 1 and 2 trim hair pretty clean so if you are trying to trim head hair first time, try it at around 5.  \n-You can open the cover and wash it in water very easily. The cover opens by slightly pressing it and pushing upwards. It's not very tight but also not loose that it might open during use.  \n-The sound is very less compared to other trimmers. You don't want a monstrous sounding machine to roll over your head, do you?  \n-Easy to handle. The body of trimmer is designed so well that it feels good to even hold it.  \n-Looks gentle. I know it doesn't matter much how your trimmer looks but still, it looks gentle. Unlike other monster looking ones.  \n  \nCons:  \n-There's no pouch for it in the box.  \n  \nHow is it better than QT4011/15?  \n-Because only features in QT4011/15 more than this is more dial points in middle of every number. For example there's 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and so on which is unnecessary. Honestly, you won't need more than 1 to 10.  \n-QT4011/15 lasts 15 minutes extra. I don't think that'll influence much because the price of that is almost double.  \n-The only pro of QT4011/15 is that it comes with a pouch.  \n  \nHope this review helps in your buying decision.\n\n", "I got a new look from this product which is at best price.Experiment and wear\na new look every day when you bring home the Philips QT4000 beard trimmer.

I am writing this review for\nPhilips QT4001/15 Pro Skin Advanced Trimmer, I bought this product on 21 June\n2016.  \nIn initials the product was charged I think 50 % of its battery. I would like\nto mention that before this order I was using Nova Nh1080 (the one which says\nhas titanium blades). It was good for me back then used it for couple of\nmonths and then one day when I removed my blades and I was cleaning them, a\npart inside where the blades mount broke, for where the bad days started I\nstarted using it with rubber bands and then I decided to visit the customer\ncare as it says it has 2 Yrs warranty. I called the customer care and I said I\nhave a nova timer which I bought online can it be repaired, the guy told me\nthey don't repair products, I said aren't you from nova care he said I am but\nwe don't deal with trimmer repairs. I searched nova care in my vicinity,\ncalled them no one replied. So the 2yrs warranty is just an eye candy for the\nbuyers online. What else everyone wants - drop the price and say it has 2 yrs\nwarranty, decent looking rating(cuz people rate the product the moment they\nopen it (and forgets all that glitters is not gold), somewhat positive\ncomments(by nova Company workers themselves) why will any opt. for any other\nproduct.  \n  \nNow to the product itself, here it's been 6 months since I bought it on\nAmazon. I think you get 10 days return/refund policy.  \n  \nThe trimmer has more power than the nova I mentioned earlier cuts the beard in\na jiffy. Looks premium in hands nice design, looks are sturdy. The blades are\ngood you won't feel the cutting action. Yes, they are very little but louder\nthan the nova. They have a dedicated service center, I checked that out and\nwhen you register the product online you get an extended one year warranty I.e\n2+1 = 3 years.  \nThey are better than nova, you might spend a little more, but you won't have\nto buy any trimmer for the next 3 years and that does save money (instead of\nbuying nova than it stops functioning after months, your trust is gone with\nnova then you buy other brands)  \nSo that was my review and I want to mention that I am not paid by nova nor\nPhillips itself, I am just another online shopper who is in the league of \"Top\n120 reviewers in Amazon''.  \n  \nI am providing you with pictures below as pictures say a thousand words oh\nactually I wrote more than that :). I feel this way you can still buy nova if\nyou want.  \n  \n[...]  \n.THANK YOU  \n  \nCOMPARE BEFORE YOU BUY. Enjoy\n\n", "The seal was broken and the packing was also not good.their were hairs on the\npacking.

Only charger was present\n\n", "It's a nice trimmer. When I was shopping around on here, I was mainly\nconcentrating on device maintenance and the versatility of the device without\nan army of additional attachments. For me, I use a few different settings to\ntrim my beard, longer on my face, closer on the moustache, no guard for\nshaping. And this thing does a good job. The guard feels fairly stout, like it\nwon't be giving out or cracking anytime soon. The device doesn't appear to be\noverly needy or anything like that, though the instruction manual for any\ntrimmer will essentially recommend you give the thing a full spa treatment and\ndinner out at The Palm before and after each use. Very quick charge, one hour\nwill turn the light solid green which (allegedly) will last for two hours of\nuse, though I haven't tested that yet. If all that turns out to be true (and\nit did fully charge within one hour), I don't think you can get better than\nthat in terms of charge vs. usage. Anyway, the rotating dial that adjusts the\nguard is fine, certainly nothing to freak about in terms of innovation. Just a\nlittle gimmick thing. I guess more than anything the motor on the thing just\nreally tears, so you feel like you're getting a good cut.  \n  \nIt's just a nice device, perhaps a little heavy on the price at Rs1.5k, but\nquite honestly, you don't have to buy trimmers very often in my experience.\nAre you going to regret dropping Rs1.5k on a device that directly impacts how\nyou like to look and will probably not have to replace for the next five\nyears? Personally, I doubt it. I think there's definite value in the long run.\nI have no problem cutting corners or going cheap on plenty of other stuff, but\nwhy on a beard trimmer? Just seems short-sighted when you're going to use the\nthing at least a few times a month and on your face.Buy it from Adityau\n.com/14 to get 10% Instant Cashback  \n  \nOh, and the last thing about this thing that I really like is the lack of\nattachments. It's just one guard/comb trimmer with 20 settings, one mini brush\nthing for cleaning it, the power cord, and one little bag if you want to use\nit. I think that's pretty great streamlining, especially if you travel. No one\nwants to pack like they're going to a barber's convention.\n\n", "As market have to many trimmer ,but the product from Phillips are the best\n,well this trimmer is best in working ,have an best body and shape and\ncharging capacity overall it is an all rounder ,I really prefer this trimmer\nover all others ,the material used in trimmer is best so the quality , and the\ndelivery of an Amazon is as usual best .\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 21 February 2018", "on 10 December 2017", "on 22 January 2017", "on 26 January 2018", "on 11 March 2018", "on 4 October 2017", "on 20 February 2017", "on 13 July 2017", "on 5 March 2017", "on 22 March 2018"], "reviewer": ["Samit", "Keshav", "Worth It Reviews", "Shaunak Surendra Khandare", "Kumar Rahul ( So.called.philosopher )", "LEO OOMMEN KURIAN", "Kapil", "Amazon Customer", "UrIndianCustomer", "Sanket"]},

Its too much noisy.  \n2\\. No USB charging.  \n3\\. Charging Indicator is in the Adapter and not in the trimmer.  \n4\\. Cordless use only.  \n5\\. Worst Packing.  \n6\\.

Box is totally damaged. Have a look on\nthis attached pics. This is unexpected from amazon. Plz take care of this one\nnext time it should not happen with any other customer. And Plz replace this\none as soon as possible.\n\n", "Pros:  \n1) Battery backup is good comparable to old models of Philips Trimmers.  \n2) Adjustable trimmer head.  \n3) Blades of the trimmer are round in shape so no cuts & Blood.  \n4) Slim design & easy to hold  \n5) No need of oiling.  \n6) 3 Years Warranty (2yrs 1 Yr on Philips Website Registration)  \n  \nCons:  \n1) No LED light indication when Trimmer is in Use.  \n2) Vibration & Sound of motor is irritating.  \n3) Takes Excess Time To Charge it full. (i.e.10 Hours)  \n  \nSuggestion to Philips:  \nPlease Provide a Cover of Traveling Purpose for Trimmer that would be very\nhandy for us to use.\n\n", "Product is good. Hope it Serves the purpose without any pain. I saw some\ndefects in vibrating blade , it is kind of melting at the contact point of\nrotor.  \nAnd packaging was not good, torn from below of box.\n\n", "This product is delivered on time and have used only once. My friend wanted to\norder the same and while looking having a closer look, found that it had\nscratches and the print on the back is faded out. Something went wrong, might\nbe used one I guess. Battery lasted for many days as it was not used and\ndrained out unexpectedly. Even after charging for three hours, the product did\nnot catch up sufficient power to use again. Apart from this product, all other\nlooked/packed new. I suggest you all to check the product and if found faulty,\ntake an action immediately.\n\n", "Used it just over ten times over a period of two and a half months. Holds on\nto the Philips brand-name and gets the job it was meant to done. Noise is loud\nbut not blaring and is within bearable limits. Can trim in the range of\n10-1mm. Runs on inbuilt lithium battery for around half an hour from full\ncharge to complete exhaustion in a single charge without getting heated up.\nYou do not have to plug it in to run; rather it does not work at all when it\nis plugged in with the mains which is good from safety perspective as it\neliminates the possibility of the user getting electrocuted. If you have tiny\nhair in good shape, half an hour should be more than enough. Plus it can trim\nthe beard to tiniest stubble you want to flaunt when you remove the clip. The\nclip is very plasticy and can easily break if pressure is applied; so you\nshould handle it with care. Otherwise build quality is okay and the shape is\nergonomic. Do keep in mind you can not wash it with water or use it in the\nshower. However cleaning it is easy; you can blow air to remove sticking hair\nand dust from the cavity where the blade is installed. Do not know about the\nafter sales servicing since I did not require it yet. To keep away health\nhazards use it for yourself only. It is meant for individual and personal use\nand is not suitable for salons. You can elongate the warranty period to two\nyears by registering online with invoice information on Philips website. I do\nnot know what will happen over a longer span of time but so far it is working\nexcellently true to the Philips brand-name which I am dearly fond of. I am\nsatisfied with the product after using it for first two and a half months. You\ncan safely opt for it if you are willing to buy one.\n\n", "The trimming quality is very nice. But comb is very loose with the product I\ngot. I adjusted the comb to 3mm, but it trimmed my beard to 2 mm. Due to\nlooseness the comb went inside 1 mm more into the trimmer. So 3 stars.\n\n", "It works flawlessly as promised.  \nGood looks and grip.  \n1-10 levels covers a wide range and that's all you need. (No need to go for\nthe costlier model which goes down to 0.5)  \nGood blades and great level shifting mechanism.  \nThough not completely water proof, you can wash the blades without any worry.  \nSolid built quality.  \nBattery lasts long. On light daily use, it lasts more than a week.  \nThe sound is okay and normal for the price. Not silent, but not really loud\ntoo.  \nIf you have really short hair, you can trim the sides and the ends evenly at\nthe level you want.  \n  \nNo LED indicator on the trimmer. There is one on the charger which lights up\nwhile charging and turns off when the charging is finished.  \nLow charge levels can be identified by the sound and vibration of the trimmer\n(gets weak in its functionality)  \nI don't know who's to blame for this, probably the courier guys than the\nsellar, my packaging looked terrible. The cardboard was pretty messed up. But\nPhilips had a hard covering on the product, so it was intact.  \n  \nDon't go for the cheap brands that comes around 500 rupees. They're louder,\nlimited in functionality and lasts for like 6 months.  \nPhilips trimmer has got robust built and 3 years warranty.  \n1000 rupees is the right price for this product.  \nPanasonic makes good trimmers too. They will be slightly quieter and costlier.\nBut not the same long working time on the battery as Philips.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 14 September 2017", "on 6 March 2018", "on 10 December 2017", "on 5 March 2018", "on 30 July 2017", "on 22 March 2018", "on 26 July 2017", "on 11 April 2017", "on 4 February 2018", "on 15 September 2016"], "reviewer": ["bhavesh", "Amazon Customer", "Amazon Customer", "Amazon Customer", "Neeraj Verma", "Jorgie Mathew", "Sandeep Kumar", "Amazon Customer", "Appu", "Jaseel JP"]},
