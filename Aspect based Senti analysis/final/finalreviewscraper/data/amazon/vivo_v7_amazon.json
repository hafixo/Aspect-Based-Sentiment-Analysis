This new model is very similar\nto the V7+ in terms of design and specifications, but with minor reductions to\nits battery capacity, storage, display size, and of course\u00a0price.  \nThe V7 and V7+ are currently Vivo\u2019s hero products in India, which is evident\nfrom the aggressive online and offline marketing campaigns the company has\nbeen carrying out. The new Vivo V7 is priced at Rs. 18,990 and hopes to\nundercut rival Oppo\u2019s recently launched Oppo F5\u00a0(Review), which is also a\nselfie-focused smartphone. We liked the Oppo F5, but let\u2019s see if the Vivo V7\nis a more compelling offering.  \n  \n  \nVivo V7 design and build quality  \nWe\u2019ve reached a point where metal-bodied smartphones are pretty commonplace in\nthe budget and mid-range segments, but sadly, Vivo doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten\nwith this programme. From afar, the body looks like it could be metal, but the\nVivo V7 has a plastic body, just like the V7+. Even so, we didn\u2019t have any\nissues with the fit and finish of the chassis and buttons. The tapered edges\ndon\u2019t offer the best grip but the overall size of the phone makes it\ncomfortable to hold.  \nThe Vivo V7 features a 5.7-inch IPS FullView display, which thanks to the 18:9\naspect ratio, fits into a body typically meant for a smaller sized screen.\nBezels on all\u00a0sides are pretty thin but there's just enough space at the top\nfor\u00a0the earpiece, front camera, and sensors. The HD+ resolution is a bit\ndisappointing, and we would've liked to see Full-HD+ instead. Some app icons\ndon\u2019t look sharp, and text on Web pages and the system UI isn't the smoothest.\nColours are fairly punchy though, and brightness is\u00a0also good. The phone ships\nwith a pre-applied screen guard.  \n  \nThere\u2019s a chrome trim running along the edges of the phone for some aesthetic\nappeal, along with chrome-plated antenna bands running across the top and\nbottom of the back. We liked the tactile feedback of the buttons and their\nplacement\u00a0is also good. On the left, there\u2019s a single tray for the two Nano-\nSIMs and microSD card. The inclusion of a dedicated microSD card slot (up to\n256GB) is appreciated. The headphones socket, Micro-USB port and the mono\nspeaker grille are all at the bottom of the phone.  \nSmudges aren't too visible on the\u00a0matte plastic back. The camera at the back\nprotrudes slightly. Vivo has also placed the fingerprint sensor here, and it\nworks well. It can also be used to lock apps. The phone has a face unlock\nfeature, which we\u2019ll get into in the next section. In the box, you get a SIM\neject tool, a case, a USB cable, a 10W power adapter, manuals, and a headset.  \nVivo V7 specifications and features  \nThe Vivo V7 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 mobile platform, which features\neight ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores and the Adreno 506 GPU. A 400-series processor\nmight seem a bit underwhelming, considering you can find phones with similar\nhardware priced under Rs. 10,000, but in practice, the Snapdragon 450 is\npretty competent.  \nBenchmark performance is decent, and\u00a0AnTuTu returned a score of 55,303 points\nwhile GFXbench churned out 33fps in the T-Rex test. Vivo has kept the RAM at\n4GB but halved the storage from 64GB to 32GB, compared to the V7+. The battery\ncapacity has been reduced a bit too, and is now 3000mAh. There\u2019s single-band\nWi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.2. Other specifications include FM radio, USB-OTG,\n4G with VoLTE support, an accelerometer, an ambient light sensor, a proximity\nsensor, a compass, and a virtual gyroscope.  \nWhile many manufacturers are easing up on their Android customisations, Vivo\ndoesn\u2019t seem to have any plans to go down that road. The Vivo V7 runs on\nFuntouch OS 3.2, which is a fork of Android 7.1.2 Nougat. If you\u2019re used to\nstock Android, Funtouch OS could take some getting used to. The notifications\nshade will only show you notifications, because the quick settings have been\nshifted to a panel called Control Centre that you swipe up from the bottom of\nthe screen. The iOS influence is very prevalent here, in everything from the\nnaming of apps to even the look of their icons.  \n  \nThe software navigation keys can be switched around depending on your\npreference, and you can hide them altogether. If you choose to do so, you\nswipe upwards from the bottom of the screen to go one step back or to the home\nscreen, but oddly there\u2019s no provision to access recent apps this way.\nFuntouch OS unfortunately does away with Android\u2019s native split screen mode in\nfavour of Vivo\u2019s own Smart Split feature, which currently only supports Google\nPlay Movies, MX Player, Youtube, Facebook, WhatsApp, and the video, messages,\nfile manager, and calculator apps.  \nThe V7 also has a face recognition feature, to unlock it when you raise it to\nyour face. It works well\u00a0even in not-so-great ambient lighting, but fails to\nwork in low light. There\u2019s a toggle for \u2018Quick recognition\u2019, which is less\nsecure, and Vivo points out that it can be fooled by a picture or video of the\nregistered face. However, we weren\u2019t able to fool it with a picture when we\ntried. Turning \u2018Quick recognition\u2019 off means that it will take a bit more time\nto unlock the phone.  \nYou get all the customisation options that we\u2019ve seen before in Vivo\nsmartphones including the ability to clone apps, a one-handed mode, and motion\ngestures. There are also a host of pre-installed third-party shopping,\nInternet and multimedia apps but thankfully, you can get rid of all of them.  \nVivo V7 performance, cameras, and battery life  \nWith everyday use, the Vivo V7 is a very good performer, and can\u00a0handle\u00a0most\ntasks very well. We didn\u2019t have any overheating trouble. In fact, the phone\nrarely got warm even when we were gaming. Despite the heavy skin, the\ninterface is not laggy, and multitasking was also handled pretty efficiently.\n4G reception is good, and the earpiece is loud enough for phone calls, even in\nnoisy places.  \n  \nVideos look good thanks to the fairly vivid display and wide viewing angles.\nThe stock headset is very basic and doesn\u2019t offer any form of isolation.\nHowever, plug in a pair of good aftermarket headphones and you'll find that\nthe audio performance is actually quite good. The same cannot be said for the\nspeaker though, which is loud enough for conference calls but doesn\u2019t do a\nvery good job with media.  \nJust like the V7+, the main selling point of the V7 is its front camera, and\nit\u2019s a pretty good one at that. The 24-megapixel front-facing sensor has a\nselfie portrait mode and supports\u00a0HDR. You can capture live photos (similar to\niOS). What we really like is the speed at which the camera captures and saves\nphotos, which makes it possible to take pretty sharp selfies even when on\nyou\u2019re moving about on bumpy roads.  \nFace beauty mode is present, and offers options for buffing, skin tone\ncorrection, and whitening. The Group Selfie\u00a0feature lets you take a mini\npanorama so you can cram more people into a shot. You can even use your voice\nor a hand gesture\u00a0to trigger the camera. Selfies have pretty good detail when\ntaken under good lighting, and in low light, you can use the fill flash\u00a0which\nis much less harsh than an LED flash. In low light, details are affected but\nthe overall picture isn\u2019t too noisy.  \nTap to see full-size Vivo V7 camera samples  \nThe rear camera has a 16-megapixel sensor with a f/2.0 aperture\u00a0just like the\nselfie camera. You get similar shooting modes here too, plus\u00a0some extras modes\nlike slow motion, time-lapse, professional, PPT, and Ultra HD, with the latter\nstitching together multiple images for a higher resolution image.  \nFocusing\u00a0and processing is quick here too. HDR shots takes a bit longer to\nprocess than regular photos. Landscapes in daylight are rendered well, with\ngood details, but distant objects often have a watercolour effect to them. In\nlow light, noise is handled well but the details are on the softer side as\nthere isn\u2019t much sharpening being done here. Portrait mode with the rear\ncamera simply refused to work on our review\u00a0unit, despite repeated attempts.  \nVideo recording tops out at 1080p and the quality is decent. However,\ncontinuous autofocus does\u2019t work here, which means you\u2019ll have to keep tapping\nthe screen to adjust focus if your subject is moving, which isn\u2019t ideal.\nThere\u2019s isn\u2019t any stabilisation either, so you\u2019ll need steady hands.  \nThe Vivo V7 is fitted with a 3000mAh battery, which lasted 10 hours, 56\nminutes in our HD video loop test. With regular use, we easily managed to go a\nfull day and then some on a single charge, which is good. There\u2019s no fast\ncharging support but the battery does fill up pretty quickly with the bundled\nadapter and we were able to get to around 60 percent in little more than an\nhour. The usual battery usage graph in the Settings app is missing, and does\u2019t\nseem to have been moved to any other section or even Vivo\u2019s own iManager app.\nThis seems to be a quirk of the custom skin. You could download a third-party\nbattery manager\u00a0and see the same information, but we don\u2019t see any reason not\nto have the native functionality.  \nVerdict  \nIn our experience with the Vivo V7, we found that the front camera does a good\njob of taking selfies, and the design is familiar but still more manageable\ncompared to the V7+. Battery life is also good, despite the slight reduction\nin capacity. On the other hand, the competition is pretty fierce, and so a\nplastic body\u00a0and HD screen don't really cut it anymore. Vivo\u2019s interface is\nalso starting to feel dated , and it's time the company overhauled it and also\nmade it lighter.  \nFor these reasons, the Vivo V7 feels a little overpriced. You could consider\ngoing with the\u00a0Oppo F5\u00a0(Review)\u00a0or the Moto X4\u00a0(Review) which are both priced\nat around Rs. 20,000 and feel more premium.\n\n", "\u25cf Great Selfie camera . You get good selfies even in night because of that\nMoonlight flash.  \n  \n\u25cf The rear camera is Good . Not the best for this price. But it does the job.\nThe ultra hd mode gives great pictures .  \n  \n\u25cf Battery life is average.
