All Of This Can Easily Cost\nAround 5000.  \n  \n========================================================================================================  \n#Cooling  \nNow Lets Talk About The Main Thing And That Is Cooing,And For That Is Really\nGood. For Reference In My Case AC Is Installed In A Medium Big Sized Room And\nWe keep The Temperature Around 25 c And It Gets Pretty Cool.So For Cooling It\nWill have 4.6/5 Rating from Me  \n  \n========================================================================================================  \n#What I Liked  \n1.Cooling Is Very Good  \n2.Budget AC  \n3.Easily Covers A Mid To Medium Large Room Size  \n4.Fans Speed Is Pretty Good With Three Adjustable Speed  \n5.Looks Gorgeous With The Lit Display In The Middle  \n6.Don't Produce Much Noise So You Sleep Peacefully At Night  \n  \n========================================================================================================  \n#What I Don't Like  \n1.The Installation Engineer Was 3 Hrs Late So Voltas, Needs To Improve That  \n2.There Is A Feature Called As Compressor Protection That Doesn't Start The\nCompressor Until 3 Min After You Switch On The AC That Means That The Ac\nStarts Cooling After 3 Mins.Even Though 3 Mins Does't Seems like A Long Time\nBut In Practical It Feels longer.So That's A Little Annoying As If You\nAccidentally Switched Off The Ac Then You Would Have To Wait For 3 Mins For It\nTo Start Cooing Again  \n3.If You Change The Fan Speed. First It Gets To The Lowest Speed Then Slowly\nReaches To The Speed You Set  \n  \n========================================================================================================  \nSo At Last Its An Overall A Very Good AC With Great Cooling And Power Saving\nAnd Hence I Would Definitely Suggest Buying It If You Are Looking For A Budget\nAC.\n\n", "While the product is good the installation done by their service partner\n(Amazon) was pathetic with nil regard for the new product. The jokers who came\nfor installation was using the outer unit as a ladder for drilling holes and\nlaying the necessary pipes as a result the fan got stuck and they had to\nremove the outer cover to make things better. After opening the outer cover\nthey didn't even bother to put all the screws back. That job was done by me.\nNow we can't just stand at one place through out to see what they are doing.\nThey didn't even have the necessary accessories like clamps, extra copper\npipes etc as a result they guy had to go shopping and the time wasted was\nclose to one hour.  \n  \nAll in all one panther service and I am contemplating calling up my\nneighborhood Ac service guy to make things better.  \n  \nLooks like Amazon doesn't even does proper vetting or give guidelines to these\nTom dick Harry's who does these installation work.\n\n", "@ Being a Mechanical Engineer I am stating few stats for better understanding.  \nNOTE:  \n# There is a 3 Star rated version of same model.  \n# Max Power consumption is rated at 1430 Watt which is comparatively lower to\nconsumption of 1613 Watt of 3 star Rated same model.  \n# This means if you use 5 star model for 3-4 hours daily, then you will save\napprox.200 rupees monthly compared to 3 star rated model.  \n# Within 10 months, the Value is recovered and then Saving begins and also\nEnvironment is Less polluted.  \n  \nNote: I do not own this product, my uncle bought it and I am stating my\nexperience after checking the product thoroughly.  \n( He's using this model since last 6 months )  \n  \nAbout this product,  \nPros:  \n1) Product is 5 star rated which is very Environmental efficient as well as\nBudget friendly.  \n2) Compressor is Rotary and serves the purpose.  \n3) Refrigerant used is R22, which gives decent cooling effect.  \n4) AC is damn silent and Pleasant.  \n5) Turbo Mode is OK.  \n6) Display on AC is quite useful.  \n7) Last good thing is Self Diagnosis, which typically states the filter change\nalert and other such minor things.  \n  \nCons:  \n1) Coil used is Aluminium NOT Copper, which is biggest disadvantage.  \n2) Bacteria filter is useful only in low pollution area, if you are Living in\ncity like Delhi or Mumbai, then it won't make huge difference.  \n3) Display on remote is very small, should have being bit larger.  \n4) Cooling takes bit longer than expected.  \n5) Finally the Cross Flow is not very effective.  \n  \nVERDICT :  \nNow the main question, whether its worth buying ?  \nFor the Price given its certainly Not worth going for. Despite of having\naluminium coil its priced around 30k which is not very lucrative.  \nSo far my uncle didn't faced any issue, but maintenance of aluminium coil is\nhuge pain which he might have to undergo soon or latter.  \nI suggest going for other models of voltas or switch to other brands with\ncopper coil only.  \n  \nThank You for reading this review.\n\n", "Note: This AC comes with Aluminum Condenser. Seller has noted wrongly as\ncopper tubes. Also some reviews have been given as Cu tubes. 180JY Jade model\ncomes only with AL Condenser (as per Voltas Installation guys).  \nOther than that this product is a value for money.

We live in the south so air conditioners are\nnecessities to surviving the summer. Most homes down here supplement their\nhome units with air conditioners unit. Technicians visited conveniently and\ninstalled it to test and it blows cold. The temps settings are ideal for our\nbedroom. The Voltas is quieter overall. This unit have quiet fans on LOW and\nwill blow so hard on HIGH that you will think you have a commercial pedestal\nfan blowing on you. I do also love that the filter is easily accessible for\ncleaning too! Can't beat the price either. These are worth their weight (or\nmore) in gold when these miserable summers are here.\n\n", "The package didn't had the drain pipe.  \nWhen the technician from Voltas arrived and opened the package, the drain pipe\nwas missing. Since I was in urgency I had to procure the drain pipe from\nmarket and then the installation was completed.  \nThe first interaction with Voltas and this happened. I am not sure what all is\nthere in the coming years. My existing AC of Samsung is far superior. I made a\nmistake of trying Voltas.\n\n", "When they installed it, the compressor was in-operational. After fiddling with\nit for a couple of days, they got it going. Mr. Chabbra from Voltas assured me\nthat this was a rare occurrence and that they would stand by their product for\nan extended period - 2 years! Since I was close to the date when my guests\nwere coming, I went along and did not opt for return via Amazon.  \nWell, now, 13 months later, after 4 months of use last summer, the AC is not\nworking and I was told that the warrantly had expired. I convinced the service\ncentre manager to be reasonable , once again explaining thr story to him. I\nwould have has to return from Canada and test the product in Winter of 2016-17\nto avail of the warranty. While helpful, this manager had no idea or\nrecollection of any of my conversations with Voltas rep from last year! NO\nRECORD or he has no assess to it.  \nTwo kids came over and said there gas has leaked and this happens to even\n\"new\" ACs, I was told. Apparently, only Voltas suffers from this malady\nbecause my other 5 ACs have gone strong for 5 years now! My question for\nVoltas:  \nIs my product a lemon?  \nWill Voltas stand by the product? Replace it?  \nIs Voltas actually a \"bad\" product, as many people seem to think? (I was\ncertainly willing to give the product a chance, but I am being proven unwise.)\n\n", "Great product. The delivery was super duper fast and the item was well packed\nand safe. Voltas team did a wonderful job by getting it installed within 12\nhours. The cost of installation taken was Rs 1000/- and NOT rs 1500/- .  \nThe only question is that the Split AC and Outdoor Component have different\nserial numbers. I am not sure if it is generally different or same .  \n  \nThe AC is working great, it is noiseless, worth for money. Amazon has SAVED Me\nRs 10,000/ due to price difference from the local market here\n\n", "timely delivered , good performance AC. Value for money deal ........\n\n", "I got AC but it does not work. I have switch on AC it takes forever to turn it\non. Also if I can switch off it takes forever to turn off. Water of money.\nAmazon do not take any responsibility of this product even if they are selling\nfaulty products. Worst experience\n\n", "I did a lot of research to find out the difference between 185CY and 185JY but\nthere was hardly anything available on the net. Now that I have both the\nmodels installed at my home, let me try to summarize the difference:  \n1) Sleep mode - In 185CY, all the lights can be switched off so it not disturb\nyour sleep but in 185JY, you will have 1 light 'on' even in sleep mode. Worst\npart is - this light starts flickering as soon as the outdoor unit shuts off.\nIf you are sleeping in a dark room without any night lamp, this may annoy your\nsleep  \n2) Looks - Aesthetically, 185JY beats 185CY hands down. It looks premium and\nthe display is also very nice  \n3) Features - One important feature that 185JY misses over 185CY is 'auto' fan\nspeed. This is a very good feature in CY which increases the fan speed and\nhelps cool faster automatically rather than you controlling the fan speed in\nthe middle of the night. All other features seems to be same  \n4) Sound level - I felt 185CY to be quieter than JY  \n5) Remote - CY remote looks better than JY but this is debatable  \n  \nOverall, a good product from Voltas other than the flickering light!!\n\n", "I have bought Voltas AC 1 TR a 1.5 years ago through other kart. Voltas AC are\nhigh on maintenance. The technicians that come from service centres are from\noutsourced agencies on turn key basis.

But post installation after 30 minutes of operation it started to\nmake a very terrible metal noise. Called Votas customer care they had a\ntechnician visit us but he could not rectify it. I have similar product\nrunning in the other room no complaints till now, possibility this piece is\ndefective. Cloudtail and Amazon are one of my favourite service providers I\nthink you should tell your Voltas Dealers about such miss in quality checks.\n\n", "The product is good. However the voltas installation service is pathetic. They\nhave outsourced installation to some Rss enterprise whose technician are not\nskilled enough. They will suggest you to install the ac at the place which\nrequire you to buy more copper pipes and other stuff. I would recommend you to\nget the 2nd opinion from the local electrician to make sure what they are\nsaying is correct.\n\n", "I have ordered this AC and they delivered defective product where the\ncompressor was not working. Voltas ppl didn't even check it before\ninstallation and got 1500 payment from us. We got to know that something is\nwrong with the AC as we switched it on and the room wasn't cooling even after\nan hour. Then voltas ppl came to check and said the compressor is not working,\nafter checking for two days. And they are also like if at all we r getting new\nAC they will charge separately 1500 for the installation again. So unfare \ud83d\ude20.

Such a bad management Amazon.\n\n", "I totally confused whether it is trust-able to purchase this kind of product\nfrom online. Finally I took risk and purchased this product. The package and\neverything was very good as per the Amazon and Cloudtail Service. After\ninstallation I found there is a crack in the drainage tray of this product\nthen I started panic but Amazon has really given confident to me that if\nVoltas Customer Care does not fix that on time then we can definitely return\nthe product with in the 10days from the delivery date. So at least I was\nrelaxed from the Amazon service side. After I following up with the Voltas\nService, it was finally fixed. About this particular model, I can say it is an\naverage product not too good.  \nDrawback:  \n1\\. Little noisy inside when compressor run  \n2\\. NO adjust for horizontal air flow  \n3\\. Cooling is very much chill but not so much comfortable - it is my personal\nfeeling\n\n", "Hi  \nthis product was bought by me, but I had an issue with this product accessory,\n(the remote) which does not work well, the installation of AC was done only in\nthe last week of November in a new site. When the amazon home services team\nwas installing it, they found that the remote control device display is not\nfunctional. Now the return and replacement window has been closed. I don't\nknow how to get a replacement remote control equipment from the seller.\nchanging the battery also did not help me to have the remote working.  \nI guess, Amazon will have a way to help me from this situation.\n\n", "It has Aluminium Compressor but don't worry if you are not living near coastal\nareas. Copper Compressor is build for coastal areas. Nothing happens to\nAluminium Compressor. Such a good product in this price. This product consumes\n1 Unit/Hour. You can calculate as per your need. Ac takes 3-4 min to cool the\nroom when room temperature is 35. It has LED display but it can be switched\noff so don't worry. To be honest , it has smooth swinging. I don't find any\nnoisy voice. Go for it.  \n  \nBUT BUT BUT  \nVoltas service is such a Ridiculous and Pathetic. Voltas technician are not at\nall expert in installation. Better is go for local technicians whom you know.\nThey never listen and given genuine answer.
