It must ve been around 50k to make it worthy and the stand is nice but cud ve been much more nicely designed..", "verification": {}, "date": "8 Jul, 2016", "reviewer": "MANUKUMAR G"},

{"rating": 1, "title": "Incompetent customer service", "review": "I had ordered this product from Flipkart for my senior citizen parents over 2 months ago. I was impressed by it\u2019s timely arrival, but since then they have given me little reason to celebrate. The product has been lying in my parents house for around 2 months and counting, with no sign of installation in the near future.\n\nI have made over 10 calls to the Flipkart customer helpline but each time I am greeted by an uninformed intern, who repeats the same monologue, \u2018I am noting your complaint and you will hear from our engineer soon\u2019. There is no commitment in terms of specific dates, phone numbers - only generics like ASAP. No SMS/email updates for my reference. All the staff is trained to do is say, \u201cI am sorry, Sir\u201d and \u201cI understand your concern\u201d which does you no good. They hide behind the \u2018system\u2019, stating the system does not allow them to do so. Flipkart\u2019s systems are designed for non transparency. When I ask to talk to a superior, I am re-routed after several minutes of horrible music to another slightly-higher-up employee who has little-to-no authority over customer service. Every time I call again in the hope that my plea will be answered I have to state my standpoint to another intern and then the process starts again.\n\nTill now I haven\u2019t asked my parents to open the box or get a third party to install it for them but looks like I will be forced to. What if the product is defective or is missing an accessory, as it happened with the XBOX I ordered, which was missing the controller. In future, there is a possibility that I might order \u2019books\u2019 and \u2018jam\u2019 from Flipkart, but definitely no big ticket items. Long live brick and mortar stores. I ordered my Hitachi refrigerator from Chroma, it cost me a 1000 more but both the delivery and installation were prompt. I so wish I had waited for my next visit to buy the TV rather than buying online.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "4 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},
