{"rating": 5, "title": "Great product", "review": "It's a great product. It has an awesome sound quality. There has been no compromise on the quality, being a wireless earphones. Few drawbacks I found, which may not be a big issue:\n1. These earphones are a little big. You'll face difficulty while wearing it with helmet on while riding a 2 wheeler.\n2. Found few disconnections while my phone was in pocket while riding the 2 wheeler. However, if I kept it nearer (inside my jacket pocket), there was no problem.\n\nAlso, I found that I was not able to pick WhatsApp calls. Not sure if that issue is from Bose or phone cause my earlier Bose earphone did not have this issue. \n\nApart from these, these are awesome earphones. Water resistant and sweat proof.

Tried these out in a Bose store recently. But the product was on Pre-Order on Bose store. I was informed that the earlier release had some sweat issues and would cause failure to headphone on prolonged use. Bose has taken back earlier versions and is releasing revised version solving the sweat issue. So make sure you get the new version instead of the earlier one with issues. It's better to wait off and buy at this moment.", "verification": {}, "date": "2 Dec, 2016", "reviewer": "Shiva Kumar Avula"},

{"rating": 4, "title": "Great product", "review": "This is my second headphones from Bose and is a great replacement for my previous soundsport wired. \nSound\nIt's clear and clean but lacks proper bass and it is not very loud but the maximum volume is distortion free and if you turn up the volume above 70%, it's loud enough and its sound is quite pleasing to the ear. Better than most headphones at this price point but I feel that you should look into beats X and jay birds before making a final decision but nonetheless, you won't regret buying this. It handles sounds of any range amazingly well and feels true to the songs. Highs, mids and lows are perfectly handled by the headphones. I listen to various genres and I have never found anything that this headphone doesn't handle well. \n4/5 \nHardware\nThe design is great and the wire connecting the earpieces is thick and the wire doesn't tangle at all. The fit is great and it feels comfortable even if you wear it for a long period of time. Since the sound is clear and quite pleasing, you won't get any listening fatigue and because of the fit, you won't feel uncomfortable. Only issue is that the earpieces are quite big and the headphone is easily visible to others. They don't fall off even while running.\n4/5\nBattery\nDecent but in comparison to the likes of Jay Birds and Beats X(which even has a quick charge feature), it is kind of disappointing. I personally can go through around half a day before i need to recharge. Around 6-8 hours.\n3/5\nConnectivity \nIt can connect to two devices at the same time and supports Bluetooth. It also pairs easily and supports NFC. \n5/5\nIn-Line controls and Mic\nYou can receive calls and attend to them using the earphones and the sound one either side is pretty clear. The buttons of the inline control are weird but they get the job done.\n4/5", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "11 Jun, 2017", "reviewer": "Prasanna Kumar"},
