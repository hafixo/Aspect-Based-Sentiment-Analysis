Configuration and performance are up to the mark.\n\nBut what if a technically sound phone irritates you whenever you use it?\n\nThe phone's internal look and feel is good. What I hate about this phone is its font, font colour, and background.  Imagine a very thin font with light grey colour and a white background. It hurt your eyes easily after using it for a while. No theme can change that irritating font style, colour, and white background. This kills your eyes slowly.\nHuawei should think about that.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Value-for-money", "review": "Hi all, \n\nI'm writing a review after a week use. I have used samsung, moto, htc before and this is the first time, trying out huweai honor mobiles. First thought to try honor 9i but I haven't seen much difference apart from camera. I have chosen this over others, for camera, better optimization, of course honor build quality and software management.\n\nNow coming to the mobile. I loved the look and design which is similar to its competitor Redmi note 4 but honor is little slim. This is definitely rich to hold, easy to handle but ofcourse slippery which is not a con ;) Display and color reproduction is good compare to other mobiles in this price range.\n\nwhen it comes to battery, not much impressed and definitely better than its another competitor 'moto g5'. I have used heavily, like high end graphic games, social media , camera shoot continuously and feel like it stays for a half day. But normal use with 4g turn on, it stays for one day. In this point, definitely should add ultra power and power saving mode option which is really awesome, to use your mobile with limited features for long time. No quick charge and takes 2 15 minutes to charge approx.\n\nWhen it comes to camera, honor gave lot of options to explore compare to other mobiles. Back camera is good. Selfie and bokeh effects are ok. Low light shots are not good. Slow motion video quality sucks.\n\nThis mobile running in an android nougat and EMI UI 5.0. ok ok feel. Rarely hangs. And performance is good. Mobile gets heated while playing high end games and charging. Apart from that, it is good unlike where moto and lenovo mobiles heats everytime while surfing.\n\nThe main con which would like to mention is less speaker audio quality and missing of IR blaster. Songs over headphone is also average. Call sound quality is also average. That's the only problem which I felt and apart from that , everything is okay and good. Hats off to the flipkart fast delivery. \n\nPS: always go ahead with 64gb, 4gb ram variant which performs better.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "25 Oct, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},

Camera quality very good., battery life more than expectations..more than 7 hour on screen experience.. Loud speakers are not so loud  but manageable. Display very nice.... I complain only for both sims are not supported 4G... Call quality good... As comparision with mi note 4. I think honor 6x is at a higer level as compare with note 4..... Its mostly equivalent to mi A1... Camera quality is better than mi A1 dual front camera... After 2 hour use there is a android 7 update... New customisations new facilities....

{"rating": 5, "title": "Super!", "review": "1.  Rear camera quality is pretty decent. But in low lighting conditions, grains are heavily present. \n2. Front camera quality is very average. Presence of grains even in normal lighting conditions and selfies look artificial even with the beauty mode turned off. And not at all suitable to take selfies in low lighting conditions. The screen flash is disastrous.\n3. Battery backup is OK . 12-13 hours of normal use. \n4. Mine is a 4GB variant. And better RAM management is an eyewash. After closing all the apps, it shows 2.6 GB available. But in settings>memory the free RAM shows 1.8 GB. So it's a nasty software trick, not a better memory management.\n5. Multitasking is good. Some apps sometimes  lag and take unusually more time to open. But Redmi Note 4 is far better in this department. \n6. Speaker quality is average. No crispness. You need a silent room to hear its speakers clearly. Music software is also trash as compared to Redmi Note 4. As a result, sound in earphone is also not as good. \n7. Fingerprint sensor is not good. Often can't detect properly. \n8.  Display is good. Redmi Note 4 is far better and you get a smaller screen here due to onscreen navigation keys. \n9. I'm using it for 1.5 months and the touch is seemingly not so responsive anymore. Often can't detect touches. \n10. There are bloatwares from Huawei that you can't uninstall. That is in case of any customized UI. \n11. Call quality is good and far better than Redmi Note 4. No issues in this department.\n\nHowever, I got this (4GB variant) in Big billion days for just \u20b910350. So for this price range, this phone is a 5 star even with its limitations. :)", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "24 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "EScapist Tathagata"},
