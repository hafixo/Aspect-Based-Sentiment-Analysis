I personally chose the iPhone 7 over 7+ because of the size. Moving from iPhone 5 to 7 was absolutely no downer in terms of size, the size suited me well. Specifications wise - still exploring. ;)\n\nWhat's evidently different - the home button (the number 3 pressure press feels quite weird. Chose number 1 option) and yes of course the no-audio jack.

{"rating": 5, "title": "i (for ideal) phone", "review": "It would be presumptuous to not acknowledge that all those who pre-ordered this device, myself included, have done it simply for the allure of the latest iPhone. Even as I say this, I wasnt entirely convinced of the iPhone 7 when I watched the livestream of the Apple Keynote. However, a timely launch in India, less exorbitant pricing and a hefty cashback was what finally swung me in favour of it. \n\nWhile Apple might have not made much headway in design for 3 generations now, I take some solace in the fact that I got the Black variant which sets it apart from the earlier generations. Having said that, the accumulation of the incremental updates is what makes this a significant step up from the 6s - IP67 protection, cleaning up of antenna lines, camera with better low light performance and OIS, stereo speakers, brighter screen with wider colour gamut, 40% faster quad core CPU, hexa core GPU and the bigger 1960 mAh battery. However, the focus will be more on what has been lost, namely, the headphone jack and the physical Home button. Coming from Android phones with capacitive only buttons, the latter doesn't matter at all, especially since it is now a multi-function button that does a lot more than the physical one. However, I must admit that pressing it felt odd initially and I mistook the vibration as flexing of the case in which my phone was encased. The loss of the former however will not be an easy one. It may have been a courageous move but also a bit impractical. I use a Sony SBH54 Bluetooth headset and the audio quality is still some way off to justify using it all the time. It is even more antagonizing when you have invested a significant amount in purchasing high-end 3.5mm jack headphones. At least, there is the headphone adapter which comes only in white and goes very well (not!) with the Black variant. I guess that is a compromise I have to live with and really hope that Apple has made the Lightning port a lot sturdier. I can somehow accept this decision if indeed, as Apple has stated, it was a price to pay for a larger battery, water resistance and stereo speakers without ruining the dimensions, even though I can accept an additional 2mm of thickness any day. Apart from the device itself, you buy yourself in to a large repertoire of accessories that simply dont exist for other devices. \n\nAs far as iOS is concerned, Apple has been more forthright about picking up whats good in others (as has Android) which means a more accelerated rate of iOS progression compared to an approach of deterrence through suing. Also, Apples walled garden now has a pet door with overtures to developers to utilize aspects of iOS that were previously, preciously locked away. iOS also continues to be the platform of choice for innovative app developers who are not simply targeting income through baited ad clicks. Even Google and Microsoft continue to offer an incredible experience on iOS which is inexplicably better than what they offer on their own platform. It is perhaps not contestable that iOS offers the best security, privacy, optimization and consistency of any phone, even though most of it comes from Apples control of every aspect of the device. Also, the exclusivity of the OS has some appeal to it at a time when Android can be experienced on any PC. To sum it up, you cannot go wrong with buying the iPhone, unless you had to take out a mortgage to finance one. \n\nP.S. I received my iPhone at around 8 p.m., about an hour after the launch and really loved the custom packaging.

When I started using Apple I phone then i realized why they cost more than any other smartphone. They have terrific after sale support. My phone was heating a bit for Initial 2 days, then i contacted apple customer service through chat and phone support and they solved my queries .Apple has unique feature of adapting when we first start to use the phone and that's why  in initial days it will heat a bit to get with the envrm and it was true.  Now I don't feel like using other phone's ,I phone are light weight and this u can feel once u start using this gem device.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Gorgeous black", "review": "iPhone 7 was launched at 7 PM IST on October 7 in India. I received an SMS at 7 PM that the delivery boy is out and I will be getting the product. I received my product at 8 PM, within one hour of the launch. With great excitement I open the packing that said priority. Upon opening I found a flipkart exclusive black box designed for iPhone 7. This packing is elegant and a surprise. Kudos to flipkart for the packing and delivery. \n\nComing to the phone:\n1) The colour is elegant. Even though the design is nearly the same except for the 3.5mm earphones jack, the colour is something which makes it different and gorgeous. The touch is awesome and the phone setup is easy.\n2) The speakers are louder than the previous versions of the phone. But I am not sure if it is 2 times the sound of previous phones.\n3) 4G reception is good. I tried Airtel 4G and Reliance Jio.\n4) The camera is good.\n5) I absolutely love the customisable home button which gives me feeling that I am pressing a button which is against the feeling of using most android phones.\n6) More storage is a delight.\n\nCons:\n1) The battery backup is not great. It is draining quite fast even at minimal YouTube and internet usage with no new apps installed and running in the background.\n2) The display satisfies my eyes but it could have been better when it comes to resolution. But I love what I am seeing.\n\nThe phone is gorgeously simple. Thanks to flipkart and Apple.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "8 Oct, 2016", "reviewer": "Nikunj Gupta"},
