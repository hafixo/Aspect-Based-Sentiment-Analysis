{"rating": 4, "title": "Good quality product", "review": "Pretty good!\n\nOk lets focus on the fact that people are posting reviews about this product saying it's bad or just ok and more lemme tell you been analysing this earphones for a while, the build quality is good, tangled free flat cords, the curve shaped design for better sound reachability trough ear canal. \n\nInside the box:-\n1)Earphones itself with medium earbuds equipped right of the box. \n2) Extra earbuds.\n3)Warranty card and user manual.\n\nPros:-\n1) Good quality as expected from JBL.\n2)Tangled free cable.\n3)Angled headphone jack for better protection from breaking off due to bending.\n4) Bass is really powerful, you will hear the punchiness right in ur eardrums. Good for metal, rock, dubstep, electro house and other heavy bass loaded music  genre.\n\nCons:-\n1) cable is slightly thin which makes it fragile and makes me worry more i might break it but it's  not that much of a problem.\n2) Little bit expensive.  would have been good if it was under 900 but ehhh 1095 rs. Is fine but still\n\nConclusion :-\nOverall just go for it guys! Its pretty good deal and good quality product invest in good things rather than cheap ones \n\n*** All of the above information is my observation and opinions the experience might vary person to person *** \n\nThanks for taking the time and reading all of this if you liked my review give it a thumbs up would encourage me to post more reviews about it till then peace \u270c\ufe0f...", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "7 Dec, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},
