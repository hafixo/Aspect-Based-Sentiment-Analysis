I was very scared because of those negative reviews and stuff and comparisons to skullcandy, but after actually using this, i am so surprised. All those negative ratings are wrong or maybe they got faulty product. Here are some pros and cons for it :-\nPROS-\n1. Awesome bass. Loved it. Those who said that bass is not satisfactory and dont go for it if u are a music lover, please ignore. The bass is very pure and will suit almost anyone. I am a bass lover and mainly listen to EDM songs, and hearing EDM in JBL is just a charm :)\n2.Nice treble alongside with the bass. No complaints in this price range.\n3.some people reviewed that headphone loudness aint enough, dude it matters with what phone you are using. I am using redmi 4 and applied 'over the ear' settings in music options, and these headphones performance just boosted like hell.\n4. Long wire cable, no issues.\n5. That orange JBL logo looks quite awesome with the black background and are veryy stylish.\n6. Comfort. The upper portion is having soft cushion for added comfort.\nCONS-\n1. Wires are thin, need to take care or you may damage them easily.\n2. not foldable guys. U cant carry it in your bag or else it will break.\n3. Yes it pains a little in the ear if u are using continuously for 2-3 hours. But thats not a major problem at all.\nThats it guys, couldnt find any other cons lol. Maybe my review helped you.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Awesome", "review": "Happy with the product! Bought it for 799 and i think it's worth it. \nAwesome sound with great bass and treble.\nJust one cons is it would make your ears painful after 2-3 hours of use. But that just ensures that the headphones is tight and doesn't let any sound escape out thus gives the best sound. \nI would recommended go for it!!", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "23 Aug, 2017", "reviewer": "Flipkart Customer"},

{"rating": 3, "title": "Very ordinary.", "review": "It mentioned it's original price as Rs 2599 and after offer Rs 749, actually the product sounds like some very normal average headset available outside, nothing great as you expect from a maker like JBL.Mentioning Rs 2599 is just a way to capture your attention. If you are a good music lover then don't go for it.\nIt's below expectations.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "16 Jun, 2015", "reviewer": "Prabhat Kumar"},

{"rating": 2, "title": "Just Not the JBL I have expected", "review": "I have purchased it for Rs.699. Delivery was quick. But it wasn't any different from my previous headphone Logitech. It is comfortable to wear , but the sound quality is just not appealing enough to declare it a JBL Product. May be next time I buy something online, I'll try and do enough research before committing to it. 2 stars. 1 for the looks and comfort, as said in the description and another for the the 3.5mm gold plated pin or whatever you call that.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "1 Mar, 2015", "reviewer": "Imbaraj"},

Good for listening music and watching movies.\n\nCons-\n\n1. Bass not that upto the mark.\n2. Sound quality not what actual JBL have.\n3. Ears start paining within 15 minutes on wearing.\n4. No microphone.\n\nSuggestion - First I have a doubt if its a real JBL product or not. Secondly, the havoc made for this product is totally false as it doesn't have that great bass, sound and build quality. Honestly, telling it is just a average product in 700/- nor that great not that bad. One more thing flipkart have raised prices to 1049/- which i think is a wrong way of showing a product prices which it is not worth off. 700 should be the acceptable price not more than that.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "18 May, 2017", "reviewer": "Uddeshya rana"},
