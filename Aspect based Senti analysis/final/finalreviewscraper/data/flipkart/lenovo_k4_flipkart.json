{"rating": 4, "title": "Wonderful", "review": "Nice phone. If u r looking for music and speed then go for this. Till now I couldn't see any cons/defects. Ya one thing is that the UI is not vanilla android UI. I feel Lenovo should have given the option to revert to vanilla android UI, owning to the fact that Moto series of phones come with Vanilla flavour. Pros are many, sweet sound quality with Dolby Atmos. 3 GB Ram which doesn't lag the phone. 5.5 inch screen and mang more. Also it has a VR mode which is really awesome.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Value-for-money", "review": "This phone is really good according to its price. But I am giving it 4 star rating bcoz the main problem is that it's\u200b battery backup is not so good . After using it for just 4-5months it's battery backup starts declining. This was really bad. My charger also stopped working with in a year. The basic problem is that there are very few service centre of Lenovo so there is a big problem from where to deal with problems regarding the smart phone. \nIf we talk about phone's display , camera, speed, connectivity , processor are awesome . This product is really good in terms of security as it has finger print sensor , scrambled pin pad, you can just speak Ur password\u200b . There are many features like it that I can check out in accessibility. Like receiving phone just by placing it near Ur ear while incoming calls . So overall nice phone u can opt for at this price", "verification": {}, "date": "4 May, 2017", "reviewer": "Jagmeet Singh"},
