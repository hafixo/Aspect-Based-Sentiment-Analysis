{"rating": 5, "title": "Simply awesome", "review": "After complaining so much about the 720p resolution and the 16gb internal storage,i finally decided to go with the LG stylus 3..Got my phone yesterday..\n\nHere are a few things to be noted-\n\n1.the 720p lcd panel has definitely exceeded all my expectations(have used Moto turbo quadHD and redmi note 3 fullHD before),i had a hard time believing it's just a 720p panel..Awesome work LG\n\n2.No,it doesn't come with NFC but has USB OTG support\n\n3.internal storage is around 10-11 GB user usable..And LG has restricted the 'adoptive storage' which means, NO..you cannot set up your micro SD card as the internal storage... However apps can be moved to SD card , the Google's ones dont move..While at least more than half of the others do..So some kind of redemption there\n\n4.the double tap to sleep and double tap to wake up is the best feature ever...Why doesn't google implement it into its android O.S???!!!\n\n5.even though the phone has an all plastic build,it still manages to look premium and feels sturdy.and it's a pretty sleek phone even with the 3200 mah powered battery and is surprisingly light too\nThe bundled cover which comes in-box is unfortunately ugly..I mean..Whats an elephant doing on the front of my cover??!!!\n\n6.if stylus is your primary reason to get a phone and you are on a budget..LG stylus 3 is near PERFECT\n\nG6, V20 and the stylus 3...2017's been good for u LG", "verification": {}, "date": "24 Apr, 2017", "reviewer": "jeson john"},

{"rating": 2, "title": "Not worth what you pay for", "review": "I've been using this mobile for 3 days. Please find below my review:\n\nDisplay:\n\nAt first, it strained my due to low pixel density. But my eyes got used to it in one day and now I feel the display is fine.\n\nAudio Quality:\n\nNot good both via speaker and headset. There is no depth and dynamism in audio. I couldn't enjoy songs thro headphone.\n\nCamera:\n\nIf camera is important to you, then don't buy this one. Clarity is not there in both images and videos. Low light images and videos are utterly useless.\n\nStylus:\n\nOkay. But a lot of features are missing.\n\nGeneral performance:\n\nVery smooth. Didn't encounter any lags at all. But I haven't tested games performance.\n\nBattery:\n\nVery poor. Charged to 99% at 7am but It died down by 5 pm for the last 3 days. Really unhappy.\n\nGeneral features:\n\nA lot are missing. For example, Long press to select or share are missing. A lot of notification block features are missing compared to basic Samsung smartphone. Qslide doesn't have calculator. So much more are missing.\n\nFingerprint scanner:\n\nSuperb.\n\nSmart cover:\n\nThe box says it is a smart cover. But it is not a smart cover at all. Just a normal flip cover.\n\nCall quality:\n\nAverage.\n\nTo sum up, this is not a value for money phone. Not worth what u pay for.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "27 Apr, 2017", "reviewer": "Stalin Maran"},
