{"rating": 5, "title": "Classy product", "review": "Though it's very expensive, but if you have the money then you should go for it. I did not buy it myself, but got this as my work computer from my company. The performance is very smooth, the OS is very beautiful and the touch bar is much more sensible than a touchscreen on a laptop. Overall I'll give it 5/5 on most departments except value for money. But then again, the brand Apple is a status symbol, and maybe worth investing in. I've known people use a MacBook for years without any issue, and I hardly know anyone to switch to a Windows PC from a Mac, but I know many who go to Mac from Windows. So that speaks for itself.", "verification": {}, "date": "1 Apr, 2017", "reviewer": "Karan Sandhu "},
