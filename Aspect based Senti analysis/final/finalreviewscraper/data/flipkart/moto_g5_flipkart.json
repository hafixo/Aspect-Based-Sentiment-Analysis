Then camera- Very bad quality of camera on this product that is not expected from moto. Then Hanging problem- It is built with Snapdragon processor but it works very slowly, many times it hangs and take switch off automatically. Then last few days I have observed a new problem, mostly I didn't see this type of problem in any other device. The problem is if you want to install a particular apps from play store it downloads easily but when you uninstall this particular apps it will uninstall but there have been created a bad effect of this particular apps and make the device very slow. \n\nMy recommendation is don't even buy any Motorola mobile, it is the worthless mobile device rather than others.
