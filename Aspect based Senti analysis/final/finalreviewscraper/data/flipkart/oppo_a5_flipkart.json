It's lightning fast. Less than a sec I can tell.\n2) front Cam is 16mp it's not bad at all. DSLR affect \n3) dedicated memory card slot (32gb)  inbuilt though\n4) decent batter life. I cud test only for aday\n5)bettr display 1080p at least better than    \n Rs 16900 j7prime LCD display \n6)user friendly UI\n7)music is good with headphones on its something new Dirac live music feel\nCons :\n1) headphones Jack pin in base very odd place,  ddifficult to hold phone with headphones on. \n2)though processor is Snapdragon 435 I felt it was bit lazy. \nSo this is the end,  plz tell me,  reply bck,  if any clarification.

Good service by flipkart.\nGood looks specially if we don't use cover.\nSupports VR due to gyroscope.\n\nCons:\nScreen is a dull, so it's not a fun to use and to watch videos. At this price, at least full hd screen should be there. Biggest drawback.\nNeed to charge it before the day ends. Battery is 2900 mAH.\nOverpriced. May be due to 16MP front camera.\n\nSuggestion: Best for selfie lovers not for mobile lovers.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "26 May, 2017", "reviewer": "Deepak Sharma"},
