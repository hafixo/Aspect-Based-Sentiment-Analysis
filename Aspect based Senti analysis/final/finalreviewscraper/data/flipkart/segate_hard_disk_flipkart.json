{"rating": 5, "title": "Is there any other 12mm Portable drives out there? Read on..", "review": "Hello World,\n\nI've Seagate Backup Plus slim 2TB two weeks before and thought of giving a video review. And it was not possible. I previously had a Samsung G2 320GB hence am little experienced how these portable drives perform, size factor, etc.\n\nI deeply checked all portable drives of storage capacity 2TB and found that, This is the ONLY drive of 12mm. WD Passport is wrongly mentioned of 15mm thickness in amazon.in and even in flipkart.com but Go to WD Site where it is specifically mentioned that 2TB version is of 20mm. All Adata, Samsung M3, etc. are of 20mm. I wanted a slimmest one hence went for this. Also I watched a Case opening video and found that, this drive had Internal SATA-USB Conversion and hence if drive goes bad, data recovery is possible through SATA Port. Surf YouTube for that info,\n\nMRP Mentioned on package is ?13990. On my purchase from \"Infiniti Retail Ltd\" seller in amazon.in, After SBI Card 10% discount, it costed ?6883.2 where in USA selling at $100, I had to give ?883 for country variation! Shipped from Mumbai on a Saturday and got product to Tamilnadu on Monday, with FedEx (amazon.in and FedEx rock!)\n\nAfter I ordered the product, I felt bad as price is very dynamic. Price went down for nearly ?50 for which I was able to able refund request. Instead crediting money back to Card, Folks at amazon.in sent me Cheque! And it\u2019s of some Deutsche Bank where I don't have account hence to redeem that money, I have to spend more! (Due to Cheque collection fee from other bank!), (Cheque is collecting Dust ;-)). Then, after 10 days price fall was drastic to approx. ?7200 where I was safe only due to SBI Card Cash back\n\nPackage was Good (Seagate logo engraved is Superb cool!) and Drive as expected as thin (I felt thinner than my previous G2!) My Desktop just has USB 2.0 and drive performs Great with Avg. 34MBps on both Read/Write. CNET had reviewed this drive and found this drive performs the best on USB 3.0 with Fastest R/W Speeds. (Read it through Google-ing for it). However on a Laptop, I get Avg. 25MBps on USB 2.0.\n\nAs, many said USB 3.0 Cable is short but is exact to connect it to Laptop or Desktop's front USB. I don't worry of length, because as of now, I don't have USB 3.0 and hence it is POSSIBLE for me to use all EXISTING MICRO-USB Cables which generally connect my phone to PC. Try using those if you have such drive and have not tried it before (Surprise!)\n\nBit Techy (For Geeks): Drive when plugged recognizes to SCSI Interface and Installs to Normal Portable drive. Drive's hardware identification name is \"Seagate BUP Slim BK USB Device\". Natively Formatted as NTFS and contain propitiatory Seagate Tools and Warranty registration tool. I formatted again and got total space of 1.81TB aka 1907729MB exactly.\n\nAs if you've read above you'll be felt positive on drive. If I have list negative or disadvantage (with great difficulty),\n1. Data activity indication LED light a little different (It dims and glows as Non-intrusive instead Quick offs-ons). With Seagate Tools, it is possible to turn off this LED but I wonder why anyone would do this!\n2. LED is positioned in Top. I prefer it be located near the USB Port like it is done in WD Passport/Essentials, so that activity is visible from side.\n3. Least one. Pricey compared to Adata, Samsung, WD, etc. Eventually I expect this drive's price will reach near US price in future.\n4. Heating? Does anyone know HDD that doesn't heatup on working???\n\nVerdict is Best buy for ? I bought for and Keep going on checkout without any more confusion, as I've already done enough analysis and comparisons for you. (I've done such detailed review like on amazon.com so that people could buy with more clarity of true info and to inspire reader to write such depth reviews on products they buy).\n\nFinally for Info, HDD originally manufactured and assembled at China. So, NOT \"MADE IN INDIA\" Product :-(\n-Indian", "verification": {}, "date": "21 Oct, 2014", "reviewer": "aRvInD G.R."},
