{"rating": 4, "title": "Nice and Easy", "review": "Well, after using this product for 9 months, I am satisfied, yes. It cleans off all the hair completely and in no time. Moreover, it makes your skin baby soft.\nUsing it is easy as stated in the title, cleaning is a bit tiresome and time consuming.\nI haven't used it with shaving foam or similar stuff but as far as the results of the dry shave goes, I am sure that the wet one would be equally satisfactory.\nTrimmer is awesome. I mean amazing. Not just the build quality but the wonders it does.....best trimmer i've ever used. And it's battery....OMG!! you charge it overnight, and it gives you 3 times worth of shaving time (I don't have much beard and it also depends on your usage).\n\nIf you are looking for a good shaver that lasts you for years and does not degrade its value with time much, look no more. Your search is finally over. Go for it and i'm sure that you will not be disappointed.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "14 Mar, 2015", "reviewer": "Rahul Gupta"},
