Loved the camera I.e. 24 MP along with Portrait Mode which actually beautifies the face and the output is comparable. The phone is really handy to use even though it has a 5.99 screen size.\nThe face recognition feature is good UNLOCKED MY PHONE IN SECONDS. So I have ordered a Gold color which is really attractive and works really fast because of the 4GB RAM, plus it is also providing a Game Mode which makes it so much more fun and easier to load high-end games, which gets better with a good battery backup i.e. 3055mAh (can be operated for approximately 24 hours).
