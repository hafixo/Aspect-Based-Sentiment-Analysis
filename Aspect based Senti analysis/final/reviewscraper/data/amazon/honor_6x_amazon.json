After 2 weeks usage, find the Honor 6X great\nvalue for money at 13k (with accessories).

Easily lasts a day with moderate usage like mine.- 4\nstars  \n2\\. Speed - With 4 GB RAM its super fast. No lags. - 4.5 stars  \n3\\. Sensor - Finger print setup and usage very easy. - 4.5 stars  \n4\\. Memory - Mine's 64 GB and am left with about 48 GB for my files. Super -\n4.5 stars  \n5\\. Looks and feel - Very compact and fits nicely in your hands. Buttons\nwithin easy reach. Not exactly premium looks, but pretty good - 4.5 stars  \n6\\. Camera - I am not a heavy user of this feature but found the picture\nquality more than adequate. Excellent edit options for camera buffs - 5 stars  \n7\\. Call Quality - Good, clear and crisp, though I would have preferred the\nmaximum earpiece volume up by two notches - 4 stars  \n  \nCons I could notice are i) made in China tag (saw it on on the box) 2) lack of\nan instructions manual &, 3) no earphones. But that's too much to expect at\nthis price.  \n  \nTo sum up, a good budget phone with Super Specs.\n\n", "It's a nice phone for this price range. I have been using this for 2 months\nnow.  \nBuild quality is good  \nRam is good, that the phone doesn't hang. The new Android 7 is has this split\nscreen option where you can run two apps at the same time. I tried it and it\nworks fine without any heating problem or without closing other background\napps.  \nTried using it with hotspot on while charging to check for heating or hanging\nissues.. no over heating problem.  \nDisplay quality is good. Nice sound quality too.  \nHave no problems in making calls or anything. The person on the other end is\nable to hear clearly.  \nThe phone has a 4G shortcut icon so that we can access 4g even at low coverage\nareas, this comes in pretty handy if you have to send a document or something\nwhile traveling or while in a low network area. Camera quality is not that\nbad. Some pics are actually pretty awesome. Camera has some good features.\nFront cam is also good. Front cam image is not dark or blurry.  \nFingerprint sensor works great. Detects really fast . Battery life is also\ngood. Doesn't drain quickly.  \nThe only setback is it doesn't have Gorilla glass. So you try not to drop it\ntoo much. Also it has a small curvy display, which is good for viewing, but it\nis hard to find a tempered glass that fit perfectly, because of the curve. But\nall the phones with curvy display has this same problem.  \nIn conclusion, I'm really happy with this phone, it's powerful, and does\neverything it is supposed to do..\n\n", "Mobile is awesome.  \nUsing from past 4 months. No single issue till now.  \nExcellent camera quality.  \nGood performance.  \nJust go for it\n\n", "The phone's camera is best you can get at this price. Performance is very\nsmooth and never lags. NO HEATHING PROBLEMS. Can handle games like modern\ncombat, asphalt extreme, asphalt 8, dead trigger 2 very smoothly. I bought\nthis phone 11 months ago and still it is as good as new.

That amounts to 11.5k and\nat this price it's an absolute steal.  \nPROS:  \n->Camera (Best in class for the price, hands down)  \n->Day to day performance is top notch and absolutely no heating. Kirin 655 rocks.  \n-> Battery life is decent 1 and half days on a single charge and normal usage. Phone charges in about 2hrs 15 minutes.  \n->All sensors are present and pedometer is a bonus.  \n->EMUI 5 is feature rich, elegant and snappy.  \n->The screen has nice viewing angles and the colours are pretty accurate. It's quite sharp and and has enough brightness for outdoor visibility.  \n  \nCONS:  \n->With dual SIM only one slot acts as 4G and the other reverts to 2G only.  \n->The back has a faint and wierd creeking sound but it can be easily fixed by using a case, so not a major issue.  \n->The speaker output has decent loudness but the quality is not up to the mark.  \n->No Equaliser settings are present in the phone.  \n->No Gorilla Glass protection.  \n  \nI would advise everyone to put case on the phone as it helps in protecting the\ncamera lens and the edges are slightly raised and screen is also protected.\n\n", "Great.  \nBattery backup is good,lasts for 1 day in normal heavy use,, but full screen\non time with hd youtube browsing will only last for 5 to 6 hours.

If u r expecting too much in Bokeh effect or portrait mode pliz don't\nsince the bokeh effect does't came out expected result as that of one plus 5\nor iPhone 7. I should say the quality of bokeh effect is poor. U wound't get\nexpected result.  \n3\\. The processor of the phone is far lacking behind if u r a gamer never\nconsidered buying it. I play some simple game and it crashed.  \n  \nOverall this phone is worth buying.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 24 December 2017", "on 21 September 2017", "on 18 July 2017", "on 13 February 2018", "on 17 September 2017", "on 1 December 2017", "on 28 July 2017", "on 24 July 2017", "on 17 November 2017", "on 16 August 2017"], "reviewer": ["Ramg", "rashique", "Srinivas", "Jabir", "Prashant", "jaison elias", "Alfanse", "Amazon Customer", "Akshay Dugni", "Gongz"]},

But this kind of dual\nsetup helps you to get a better low light pictures. That's why OnePlus also\nSwitched to this setup in op5 T . And the front cam is just the best you could\nget at this price point, no other phone perfoms so well with front cam.  \nYa if you just need a 2x zoom and better portrait choose the Mi a1 , and need\na better low light, selfi mode choose this one and the pro mode is best part\nand no other phone would provide such a pro mode. Ya I know Honor 7x has come\n, but it's not a big upgrade as screen resolution is lower and beside the\ninfinity display the phone has nothing new , even the design is not good for\nregular use as could damage the cam setup. Processor is a bit upgraded not\nthat much.  \nBut I think proper care and covers may help & choosing that one is also good\nif you just need a new gen display. But if you want better resolution opt for\nthis or honor 9i (which is bit costly).  \nPerformance___________________________________the performance is good and can\nplay many of the graphic intensive games without lags and can store much of\napps and games . So performance is not a issue, sometimes now I get some\nframedrops in some of the games very rarely I think it's bcz I have loaded\nmore than 100 apps and games.  \nDesign_________________________________________design is good but very prone\nto scratch and damages as it is metal surfaced , a slight hit could get some\nstraches or bends and the screen is too delicate can break if you drop it down\n. So get a tempered glass and cover so that it doesn't get damaged.  \nMany say that the audio quality of speakers is not good . But actually it's\ngood and gives loud sound in indoors.

U can also change the color of the display And\nits size too. This mobile gives so many inbuilt applications to enjoy such as\nmirror, campus,health check and all UC apps.

I just really dnt like the branding in front wasting so much space..  \n5.let look into some NO - NO ir (infra red )facility + in redmi devices, No\ndouble tap sensor, No fast charging its usb type B only ...dont use while\ncharging..back is metallic one so u will feel definitely heat .. after\ncharging remove the pin keep for 5-10 mints then use ..  \nNow PROS Which u will like more  \n1.BATTERY-..NEVER EXPECTED This from honor ..its a 3400 mah battery ...but it\ncan make ur whole day ..screen on time with mobile data like heavy usage -\neasily u can get 13-14 hrs a day..for rest if ur a just popup visitor u can\nlast for 1nd half day easily... specifically should mention about the power\nsaving modes  \n2 modes - power saving mode& ultra power saving mode -excellent ways for\nbattery life  \n3.RAM management- u wnt believe this ..actually i got 3 gb ram one ..in my mi\ntab when i open about 10 apps the ram will be about jst 100 mb left and phone\nwill be slow...but i was shocked with honor ...i nearly opened about 15\napps..its still gives 1.8gb freee..and when u open these apps they wont reload\nalso...this might be the main reason for such a long battery life also..i was\nso impressed  \n3.CAMERA- As u all knw it is at its best..best thing is front cam is so good\nand in artificial light alsoit gives u the best output.. but dnt expect beyond\nwith this..its a 13mp cam only it cant make miracles in CLARITY but showcases\nthe pic in beautiful way ..up on zooming its all grain u get ..but its the\nbest camera i have used around 10k range..best for photography people  \nConclusion-BADLY needed batterylife and photography..go for it  \nBut if u luv music - think twice /thrice before buying it ..\n\n", "I am so happy with this Honor mobile!

Additional uses of fingerprint sensor like swipe left right to change\npicture when you have opened the gallery. Swipe up down to open notifications\nand swipe right to clear notifications.  \n8\\. Front camera takes pretty good selfies.  \n  \nCONS :  \n1\\. Hybrid slot  \n2\\. No USB C type cable  \n3\\. No front flash  \n  \nVerdict: If you are confused between redmi note 4 or honor 6x then you must go\nfor honor. If you think about price then it is only 1k more than note and on\nthe occasion of so many sales on Amazon you can get it for 13k which is\nsimilar to redmi note 4. Redmi note 4 only have more mah of battery but in all\nother departments honor 6x completely outclass RMN4. And when it comes to\nbattery also it has quick charge which takes less time when it comes to\ncharging. So without having a 2nd thought you can go for this phone if you are\nlooking for a solid smartphone with pretty good camera, battery, performance\nand after sale services.

It's quite sharp and and has enough brightness for outdoor visibility.  \n-> Recently working on Naught 7.0 and to the Oreo 8.0 is on the way,  \nCONS:  \n->With dual SIM only one slot acts as 4G and the other reverts to 2G only.  \n->The back has a faint and wierd creeking sound but it can be easily fixed by using a case, so not a major issue.  \n->The speaker output has decent loudness but the quality is not up to the mark.  \n->No Equaliser settings are present in the phone.  \n->No Gorilla Glass protection.  \n  \nI would advise everyone to put case on the phone as it helps in protecting the\ncamera lens and the edges are slightly raised and screen is also protected.\n\n"], "verification": ["Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase", "Verified Purchase"], "date": ["on 13 October 2017", "on 30 September 2017", "on 19 January 2018", "on 6 March 2018", "on 13 August 2017", "on 14 October 2017", "on 27 August 2017", "on 12 February 2018", "on 21 August 2017", "on 21 February 2018"], "reviewer": ["Subhadip B.", "Roop Kumar Chatterjee", "Ashish Ganguli", "Amazon Customer", "Sekhar", "Amazon Customer", "Amazon Customer", "Anup", "Bikash Prasad lal", "Harnish pithadia"]},

Back Camera is good - better than redmi 4 but not as\ngreat as some reviews suggest. And after installing many apps n multitasking(\neg running multiple browser windows , hotstar, prime, YouTube, wync, camera n\nfew more apps) I noticed some lag, nothing major though. Other than what most\nreviews already hilighted in pros n cons I would mention \"eye comfort\" as\npros.. Con would honor \"Mirrorshare\" is not smooth with my LG TV campared to\n\"super cast\" of my Lenovo phone.

Much Much better than crappy yellow\ntones on MI displays which you can't control.  \n\\- This makes it very good phone to edit pictures  \n\\- Deep enough blacks  \n\\- Huawei models are available internationally as compared to MI that are more\nintended for Indian market  \n\\- Huge difference in streaming music over bluetooth when compared with Moto G\n5. Music quality over bluetooth is much better than Moto G 5.  \n  \nCONS  \n\\- Only single sim supports 4G (WTF...)  \n\\- Krin processors with EMUI are bit slow as compared to rivals like MI  \n\\- Slow to charge when compared to MI phones with same battery capacity and\ncharging specs (5V 2.1 Ampere)\n\n", "I have used lot of phones, but I love this phone so much.

The best part what I like is its UI, it's is very soft.\nThen in performance and built quality is too good. It just have an amazing\nlook too. I think person who are thinking to buy this they should just go with\nthis phone otherwise they will miss something really very important and\namazing device.\n\n", "Based on 2 months experience,  \n  \n1)Best phone for the price.  \n2)Good pics in low light too.  \n3)Battery performance is also nice.

The 7x is in market.\nall focus will be on promoting 7x. And they had already given 1 major update\nfor 6x. The only thing I did not like was the fraudulent promotion of honor 6x\nin the second half of 2017. There were news about oreo update confirmed for\nhonor 6x with reffence of some company person's statement. After this price\nwas droped. and then after few months 7x was released. Looking at this, it was\nvery clear that news of \"confirmed oreo update for honor 6x\" by the end of\njanuary 2016, was a marketing stratergy to clear the stock of 6x befor release\nof 7x. Company was not openly denying the oreo update to 6x till now because\nthey don't want to affect the 7x sale. Not giving major android os update is\nimportant negative point for any company. So we were getting vague answers\nthat \"the update is under evaluation\".  \n  \nAgreed that they had given one major update for 6x, but the phone (released\nwith android 6) had many important issues such as volte connectivity problem.\nPhone was officialy released in feb 2017. in the current competition of\nsmartphones, users expect at least 18 months (if not 2 years) of update\nsupport. Also considering (false) marketing of confirmed oreo update for 6x,\nits expected that company shoud have given oreo update for 6x.  \n  \nI think 6x users, who were highly expecting oreo update, shoud take out at\nleast 2 to 3 min to post about this issue on social media and importantly in\nthe Amazon review of honor 7x. Spreadinig \"Huawei is the company which does\nnot give major updates\" is the only way to force them to rethink their update\nstratergy. Same thing had happen before with Samsung (The update policy was\nimproved from worst to average ;)  \n  \nNot only Android update, there are many minor and some major issues in honor\n6x. Heating, bleutooth syncing/connectivity Camera, etc.  \n  \nGood bye to Huawei - my first and last phone of Huawei company.

Battery back up is also too\ngood as i use fb,watsapp and several app at 9:30am but at the end of the day\nbattry shows 67% which sounds good.
