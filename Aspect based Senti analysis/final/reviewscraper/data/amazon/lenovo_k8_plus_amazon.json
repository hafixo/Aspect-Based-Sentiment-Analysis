Average camera with worst ever bookeh effect.  \n  \nLenovo should fix this issue in next update otherwise it will lose another\ncustomer.  \n  \nCustomers are not the priority for lenovo that is for sure.  \n  \nLenovo please take care of this issue.

Heating is\nanother issue, when you play games or record a video it gets heat. Also the\nbattery is not that great, turbo charging takes about 1.5hrs to charge and it\ndrains fast.

Processor and Camera is good. No buffering while watching videos in you\ntube / live tv / dedicated portals of TV network.  \n2\\. Trendy look, easy handling and lenovo could have provided headsets in the\naccessory kit. That was missing!!!!  \n3\\. Turbo Charging was good initially after couple of months it started\ndeteriorating from its set standards. It takes time min of 1.30 hrs for 20%\nwhen the battery capacity is at 80%.  \n4\\. Battery life is not as expected for 4000 mAH. For a non gamer with limited\ndefault apps it should last for more than a day when used fully under mobile\ndata. But battery drains out quickly.  \n5\\. Ear piece volume: there is a problem in all lenevo mobiles that, while on\ncall near by person can hear the voice of other person. Its very pathetic when\nit comes to whatsapp calling. It gives us a feel, like we put our mobiles on\nspeakers. The volume is too loud even though the same is kept at least level.\nLenovo technical team should pay more attention on this set back.  \n6\\. Audio Output : Could feel dolby atmos effect only when we keep our palm\nnear speakers. Else this feel is missing completely. Its because of single\noutgo at the bottom of the device due to which this feature got misfired i\nbelieve. Tested this feature specifically with dolby atmos effect videos which\nis widely available in web pages.  \n7\\. Otherwise, got this mobile on deal. So when compared with other models i\ngot the device for what i have paid for. i should compromise myself in that\nway.  \n8\\.
