{"rating": 4, "title": "Really Nice", "review": "Hi everyone, I would like to share my experience of using honor 6x on third day of my owning it.\n First I would like to mention what I always look for in a smartphone before planning to buy a smartphone. Without mentioning that putting forward my views is of not much to use for the one who is looking forward to buy one. \nEveryone has different criteria based on which we rate the Product. \n\nFactors on which I usually buy a Mobile phone are.\n1. Battery - cause I believe how much  good a phone is in terms of its features . it is of no use when it can't hold its charge for a good amount of time.\n2. Reception - what use of a phone that has no good signal reception.\n3. Display n Sound - Lack of good Display n soothing sound doest appeal much to me.\n4. Touch - Without a good touch , I won't feel like touching it. \n5. Camera - I am not a cameraman but a good camera is useful when I get a chance to capture nature's beauty.\n6. Sensor-  Not many people but I am a person who count on sensors before I buy a Mobile.\n7. Built quality- A good feel in hand is a must for a good piece of hardware is what I feel.\n\nSo based on these few criterias, I am going to review my Honor 6X of Huawei.\n\n1. Battery:  I am quite impressed by the battery back it provided me on its first charge generally we don't get a good backup from a new battery untill a couple of charges. I charged the phone to 100% and started using it from 13th Nov 15:30pm. I used it for calls played cricket game took calls on bluetooth etc. To make a long story short, on 15th Nov at around 6:30 am my battery was 49% with a screen on time of 4hrs 14 min. I think it is nothing short of impressive backup. \n2. Reception:  signal reception is also very good it catches signal where other most of the phones fail.\n3. Display is just awesome sound is also very good though not as good as Samsung j7 Prime. Display is better than j7 Prime.\n4. Touch : I can say it's touch is very touching. It's just touchsome.\n5. Camera: Captures the details to a far extent. It's just outstanding n feature rich camera due to its numerous options.\n6. Sensors: Has all the necessary sensors. Like magnetic n ambient n gyro etc.\n7. Built quality : It definitely give us a feel of a premium quality Mobile in hand.\n8. Processor is very responsive and felt better than j7 Prime. Last but not least it has a good RAM management hence it contributes to a good battery backup.\n\nI am using Airtel on my handset with no sd card. I am using mobile data and Wi-Fi for browsing.\nHopefully this might help someone b4 making a purchase.\nI think it's the best phone under 15k. Let me know if my review helps u in any way.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "15 Nov, 2017", "reviewer": "syed mustafa"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Simply awesome", "review": "After a long confusion between Lenove K8 Plus and Honor 6x I go for this because of it camera performance .Only if some one comfortable with 5.5 inches scene then this is a worth deal.\nPrice : I purchase this on big billion sell at 9899 Indian rupees. I think no doubt it is a great deal.\nScreen : The handset screen is awesome. I use other 10K mobile but I never so impress as this make me.\nBattery Life : The battery life is really awesome. With moderate usage I get about two days of battery life. This is just too good with this 3340 mAh battery. \nWeight : Phone is not to heavy . Comfortable with one hand usage with this weight.\nCamera : This phone really have a good camera. Normal mode picture have good image with great color and details.In terms of details I personally compare it with zenfone 2 max .I notice  two phone have almost same amount of details .But honor 6X have better color and over all effect slightly better details. Depth mode is really interesting to use.Good effect.All though it come to market a one year ago but still it is a unbeatable in this price bracket and 9899 it is the best  camera with any doubt.\n Software : I personally prefer stoke android. But this will have a custom UI  EMUI 4.1 which is  stable .I hope With the Nougat(7.0) update it will be more close to stoke android. I hope it will get the Oreo(8.0) update too.(Just my guessing).\nGame: I personally not play much game .Can't say much about that.\nHeating issue: No heating issue during normal usage .Slightly heated during charging but I think this is natural.\n\nFlip-kart service : Flip-kart service is good with no issue. They have make there Delivery with in time.\nI brought two variant one grey and one gold variant( for my friend) .It is surprising to see that the grey variant is printed made in china but the gold variant is printed as made in India. \n\nOverall I think great deal in 10k.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "28 Sep, 2017", "reviewer": "Suman kumar kundu"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Three thumbs up!", "review": "1st to flipkart: for offering this product at a good discount, delivering a day before estimated day and also for partnering with Bajaj finserv. \n2nd to Bajaj finserv itself : for acting as the wish Master of Middle class. For those like us, who can't own a credit card, Bajaj EMI card is the savior. \n3rd to Huawei: for producing such impeccable chipset (Kirin 655) and to use it for this awesome handset. \n\nLemme get straight to the pros and cons of honor 6x(3gb, 32gb variant):\nPros:\n1. EMUI: the ui, though outdated, works like a charm. Highly optimized and consumes RAM moderately. \n\n2. Build quality : as usual Huawei standard except for the protrusion of antenna line. Fingerprint scanner is highly accurate and fast. \n\n3. Camera: Rear camera is interesting to use with plenty of modes and filters and good for daylight photographs. \n\n4. Performance : all the high demanding games and apps work seamlessly, despite the custom skin atop.\n \n5. Battery: 3340mAh is enough to last just more than a day under medium to heavy usage. 2A charger charges the battery 100% in almost 160mins.\n\nAll other lil aspects such as call quality, network reception, speaker,  sensors do work well. \n\nCons:\n1.REAR CAMERA: being a camera centric smartphone, Huawei has unfortunately missed out on aperture.  The rear camera is a f/2.2 one which means significantly smaller than f/1.9 of similarly priced Samsung on max or j7 prime etc.  And the results are too obvious in night shots. \n\n2. FRONT CAMERA: 8MP FF front snapper does justice in daylight. But again in artificial light, it suffers badly and the screen flash is just a gimmick. \n\n3. HYBRID slot: Although every good phone in this category has this con, I sincerely feel bad for it. \n\n4. NO DISPLAY PROTECTION: when you have a 2.5D glass, tempered glass can't be used conveniently, which means you've to rely on scratch guard sheets. Considering this, Huawei should've at least provided dragon trail glass. \n\nConclusion: you'll be lil disappointed with the cameras at times, but never with the performance and practicality of this device. Truly a better alternative to RN4(Camera of RN4 is far behind that of 6x).\n\nWant a better option? If photography is important for you, go for samsung. If pure android is your love, go for moto g5s or g5s+. If you need a performer,, the honor is the best. \n\nHit like if you find it helpful.", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "12 Dec, 2017", "reviewer": "Rajesh Sundararajan"},
