{"rating": 5, "title": "Must buy!", "review": "100% honest review, used it fully for about 10 days now.\nFirst of all the build quality of the phone is awesome, feels premium.\nScreen is good though not completely bezel less but yes its impressive both on and off. The FHD+ resolution is really good,crisp,sharp and vibrant. Super smooth touch. Aspect ratio 18:9 provides good viewing experience especially videos and apps that supports it.\nNext, UI is pretty good, I personally feel that it is better than MIUI.\nSound quality of main speaker and the earpiece is very good, loud and crisp. It also has loud voice mode for calls for better sound.\nFingerprint sensor is good. Provides additional functions like pulling down the notification bar and scroll through photos. Clicking pictures is a standard feature now a days.\nNow come to the Camera which is one of the USP of the phone. The front camera is 'ACTUALLY' better than the rear camera. For the \"BOKEH\" effect you may have to struggle a bit while using the rear cam but it is quiet easy in the front cam. Some people are putting negative reviews because they can not take bokeh effect shots. Let me make it simple for you, in the camera interface, the top bar has options in which second one is the portrait mode. Turn that on.Then in the bottom right you have two options vertically aligned.\nThe first one in the option to turn bokeh effect on or off(second one is the beauty level with a icon of a female face). Remember bokeh effect only works in the portrait mode. The procedure is same for both front and rear cam.\nFacebook apps sometimes hangs the phone. (They do it in all phones,this is not an exception).\nBattery could have better, but it easily holds for a day on normal usage and may last even longer with minimal usage. Two power saving options are present. Ultra power saving may provide some more hours in standby mode which is actually good when you are travelling without power backup.\nPersonally speaking the 11K variant is best buy. 15K for 1GB extra ram and 32GB extra storage is not justified.\nLast but not the least, you will be satisfied by this phone. It is good.\nHOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS. THANKS ALL", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "4 Feb, 2018", "reviewer": "Saurabh Vashishth"},

{"rating": 5, "title": "Terrific purchase", "review": "Hello\n\nBefore purchasing this product I have used MI A1 and Redmi Note 4 . I will try to compare these 3 phones as per my experience.\n\nI used redmi note 4 for almost 9 to 10 Months. Overall experience was really good the only problem which I faced is the weight and even the front camera. Later on my birthday my wife gifted me the MI A1 .... Again the same issue the weight and the size of the device was more , But it clicks really good pictures from back camera. I felt MI A1 a very boring device because of its UI which was stock android. I really enjoined using MI devices because of its MIUI. Because of this reason I sold MI A1 and Purchased this lite weight beauty.\n\nAdvantages of purchasing 9 Lite:-\n\n1. Perfect phone for 1 handed usage and lite weight.\n2. EMUI loaded with lot of customization and Functionalities\n3. Front facing camera clicks really good selfies at this price range\n4. Display , Build and Design of the Phone is top notch.\n5. Network reception and call quality is perfect\n6. Medium level games like WCC2. Sachin Saga, Asphalt Nitro can be played without any lags.\n7. Fingerprint scanner unlocks the phone in fraction of a second.\n8. Last but not the least Back cover provided with in the box fits perfectly and does not make phone in hand feel bulky.\n  \nDisadvantages:-\n\n1. Back camera is average if compared with MI A1.\n2. Sometimes we can see a minor lag hope it will be fixed in upcoming OTA update.\n3. High end gamer has to rethink before purchasing !\n4. EMUI comes with some uninstallable bloat-wares \n\nI hope my review might help to decide whether to go for this device or not!", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "23 Jan, 2018", "reviewer": "SUMANT GUDIHAL"},

Quad cameras is a TOTAL MESS. Rear camera is so damn horrible ...that I have no words to explain. Front camera is somewhat better.\n2. Battery backup is reasonable as long as you don't end up playing huge games ( heating is also normal, not bad at all).\n3. 18:9 display is so majestic...that...I felt...I've paid this money ONLY for that display. So brilliant is its display.\n4.  Glass back gives you a premium feel ( Fingerprint magnet as well...this phone unless..you starting using a good back cover or the one supplied by Huawei ).\n5. No lag AT ALL on most of the applications I have used ( mind you: I am not playing DEAD TRIGGER or ASPHALT 8 which revealed frame drops).\n\nWith these observations...I want to say, for 10,999...you are getting a smartphone with decent performance.

M not a heavy user bt as i used it from last 8 days  so iam here to give my review so it can help you if u wann buy it...so we will start from its camera as it is highlighted by brand. \nOverall rating- 9/10\nValue for money... \n\n1.camera-8/10\nRear camera - 7/10\nAs the camera is good in light bt sometimes u will find that the edges are not clear cut as in mi a1 or in other smartphone from that budget.. \nLow light quality of camera is not so good bt yeah detailing is good in low light, as camera have the spe cial features for the low light it will improve the quality of pictures bt you have to wait it for some time, \nThe best feature of camera is light painting, if you have a skill nd if you are photography lover then this will be really helpful to you...\nThe depth mode nd the bokhe effects are good.. Bt in portrait mode you will find that somewhere edge's are missed up.. \nThe quality of video recordings is good bt as it doesn't have an optical image stabilisation the video unstable.. Bt overall quality of recording nd voice is good. \nFront camera-9/10\nI think this is the one of the best camera in 16k budget smartphones... You have a options like depth mode nd filters too, the overall quality is very good, detailing are also good, nd in low light screen flash option is there.. Portrait mode is better than rear.. \nThe depth mode is good enough.. Bt in low light quality becomes low than the normal.. \n\n2 Battery - 7/10\nAs it has 3000mah battery obviously you will find that it will drain fast as compared to other devices... The overall batteries life is average bt thanks to the company as there is inbuilt power saving modes are there which can improve battery life much better...if u wann then u can add 1 star for the power saving modes which really works good nd help you to save power upto good extent. \n\n3.  performance 9/10\nAfter 8 days of use... I hav find that therr is no lag when you're playing heavy games on high settings... The graphics is very good, nd games play smoothly...\nI have used asphalt xtreme, modern combact 5, shadow fight, gods of rome nd many other heavy games the overall graphics nd performance is  best in this price range...as it has a powerful kirin processor it makes the heavy tasks easier... Nd one of the  best thing is it already comes with the android oreo 8.0, which makes your phone smooth nd fast... \nSo overall quality of the performance increases \n\n4.scree.-9/10\nThough the screen is quite large enough u can easily handle it with your 1 hand, \nThe brightness is very good, 18:9 aspect ratio of screen is very good,\nBt some were you will find that the colours are warms than normal bt its fine.. \nOverall its better than other..\nThe display is full hd+ nd the quality of pictures is really jst an awsm..bezeless display increases the beauty of smartphone.. Once you hond it in your hand, you feel that its really a good thing... \n\n5.Look-9/10\nThe look of the mobile is really awsm you will enjoy it bt while enjoying make sure that it will not fall down..\nAs the back is also made from the glass so u have to take care of that.. I have deducted 1 star bcoz i didn't find that the building quality very high, bcoz as it has glass on both of its side, there must be gorilla glass at least 1 of the side bt u didn't find it...\nSo take care while handing nd use back cover which is provided by company... \nWhich is a goo6 thing...\n\n6. Charging-7/10\nAs it doesn't have a fast charging mode so u cant charge your mobile fast..... It will almost take 2hrs30mins for full charging from 0 to 100% which is not so good... \nSo the charging is slow..\nSo this is the overall review guys if you have some queries then reply.. I hope it will be useful to you...", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "31 Jan, 2018", "reviewer": "Onkar Pardhe"},
