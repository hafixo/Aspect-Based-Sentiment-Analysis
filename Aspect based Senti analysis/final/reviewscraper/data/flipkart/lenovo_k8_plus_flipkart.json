It's a bulky and heavy device, check and compare dimensions. \nApplications are running smoothly. I read in articles that it doesn't have FM radio and 3.5mm jack but that is not the case. \nOne issue you might find is that it doesn't have inbuilt Gallery app. You have to download an app from playstore, which can have annoying ads. \nTouch is smooth, display quality is not that great but for 11k you can't expect more I guess. You might want to check MI 4 if your friend has one to compare.\nSharp images are captured with dual camera. But problem is that colors wouldn't be same in images as you see them with your eyes.

It charged to a full 100 in 2.5 hours... In which, it charged upto 35 in half an hour. I used it mainly for internet and videos, played a few games just to check the graphic performance and after one whole day (24 hours) I was left with 20% battery. It's amazing.\n\nAudio: Dolby Atmos. Enough said. You will know if you have a nice pair of headphones. \n\nGraphics: played asphalt 8 for 30 mins without any lag at all.\n\nSpeed: Didn't do any benchmarks. However, the animation scales, booting up time AND multitasking is smooth as feather. \n\nCons\n\nCapacitive buttons: the capacitive buttons on the phone are not backlit, niether are customisable.\n\nHeating: it gets a lil heated while charging and continuous gaming. Wasn't an issue for me but can be for people in extreme conditions.\n\nCamera: BIGGEST con of the phone. The camera takes fine ish photos in outdoors and in day times, but pathetic indoor photos. The torch is eye blinding bright, and I won't recommend this for phone photographers. Front camera is average.\n\nNo notification light.\n\nThere are two grills at the bottom for speakers but only the right one works. It would have been an amazing experience if both of the speakers worked.\n\nOverall the phone is a bang for buck.

They can't identify you easily\n\nThat's it overall it's a great phone for under 10 k but not worthy for 11K and above seriously !!\n\nInitial Impressions \n\nLooks : \nIt looks sturdy but dono wether it will survive some occasional drops it has Corning gorilla glass in front and the back is slippery like anything so buy a case immediately !! And lil heavy in hands but 4000 mAh battery and metal casing no complaints !! And the phone matches the size of my redmi note 3 !! Even though it's a 5.2 inch screen cud nee becoz of dual cam setup and non hybrid slot !! Kudos Lenovo for that stuff !!\n\nPerformance : \nEven though it's a mediatek CPU its just super cool with continuous usage of one to two hours with half brightness and auto brightness on  and 4G connectivity volte enabled which covers a bunch of apps download too \n\nThe phone gets lil warm but you can't hardly notice it ! Very less not noticable !!\n\nUi : \nUI is pure stock Android raw aosp with some minor tweaks it gives micro lag experience some times shud be UI fault !! Again it won't be a big issues just micron second !! Other than that it's fluid smooth and handles better all apps no Force closes !! I played some basic games great experience no lags and no over heating checked with CPZ , temperature maintained within 40 degrees after 40 minutes of play all mediocre games with medium brightness and auto brightness on and 4G on\n\nCamera : \nI'm not a pro potographer !! For the camera does great in good light conditions and decent in indoor light conditions and noisy in low light conditions !! So obviously budget camera performance !! \n\nThat's it guys !! Hope my review is helpfull but sorry for long discription !! \n \nRegards \nKesavvel", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "23 Sep, 2017", "reviewer": "Kesav Vel"},
{"rating": 1, "title": "Must buy!", "review": "Dear flipkart nd flipkart customers,\n        I have placed order to the store INDIFLASHMART for LENOVO K8+ smart phone on September 8th. I received my product on September 11th. When I used my phone in dimlight for the first time with the Adaptive brightness option, I noticed heavy flickering on the display. Then I unchecked the Adaptive brightness option and kept the brightness to the minimum and checked the display, it was flickering continuously. But with brightness as maximum, the display was without any flickering. So to find the reason for this defect, I contacted Lenovo technician through chat through their native site. They suggested to restart the phone and use the phone in safe mode or perform factory reset. I tried both the option but still the defect was not resolved. So I decided to ask for replacement to the seller INDIFLASHMART on September 14 for the above mentioned defect . But I received a mail saying that my request was rejected and they gave the following reply - \n\n\"\"We are sorry to hear that you are facing a problem in the display for the above mentioned product. \n\nWe request you to follow these simple steps that?ll help to fix your issue. \n\nDrag down the status bar \nMove the Brightness slider \nOR \nTap Menu \nGo to Settings \nSelect Display \nTap Brightness Level \nMove the Brightness slider \nIf required, turn OFF Adaptive Brightness \"\"\n\n\nIs this the way ur sellers respond to ur customers????? The fault is with the phone's display and I was asked to adjust this defect with the settings...\n\nI have purchased nearly 5 to 7 phones from ur site. But this is the first time I am facing the problem like this. I am completely taken back by the irresponsible answer from the seller....", "verification": {"CERTIFIED_BUYER": true}, "date": "12 Sep, 2017", "reviewer": "kartheeswaran"},
