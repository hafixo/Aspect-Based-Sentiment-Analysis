This Moto x play 16gb variant I say look perfect months. The display good. No blur images I say still look like damn good phone. I remember many times I put phone see major damage outer surface except little tiny bend. Also I uses chevron armored back case device gives phone extra protection. Some like case make phone look bulky uncomfortable use yes depend preference. I would recommend use back case choice link best cases moto x play. And overall 10 months display seems good vibrant.
